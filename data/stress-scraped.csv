The mind is extra physical and spiritual in nature.,"The records of both Americans and British societies for physical research are filled with case reports of telepathy, clairvoyance, astral projection, remote viewing, and similar abilities.

Still many people despite the published reports of scientific findings, are prone to go into attack mode when the idea that these abilities exist.

All of these have even been mentioned in religious books, but today, some of those followers will say that it’s impossible.

Some of the greatest scientific thinkers have declared that these abilities are not only possible but that it is a faculty that can be used by most people when they understand it.

Studying and experimenting with the spiritual energy that can come with goosebumps has helped me experience many of these psychic abilities.

How? 

This is your spiritual energy that comes from your energetic (spiritual) body and truly understanding it is one of the simplest keys for these abilities.

This energy is know throughout many cultures and different languages as Euphoria, Tension, Chi, Prana, Ecstasy, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Mana, Frisson, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, The Force, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy and Spiritual Chills.

Here's a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdVJk7Qd_fU) that explains this energy and how to use it to your advantage.

College stress,"Hi, Im currently at a college I hate about 3 hours from home. Ive had a very bad semester where I developed anxiety and depression symptoms. The academic part wasnt the issue, but living in a city with nothing I enjoy doing is what was so hard. I was bored everyday until friday night, I would just pace in my room watching youtube and never leaving. I have recently started eating less, adn wanting to do less. I just find it weid that all this can happen when im so close to leaving. I talked to someone I know whos dealt with anxiety for a while and they said it common to get worse for a few days when you're so close to being done. Just wondering if anyone could confirm this? Also with me eating less, my stomach is telling me im hungry, but I dont feel like getting food all the time (I dont feel like doing much here at all).",Various-Tangelo-6003,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/ub15nv/college_stress/,0

Girlfriend’s family stresses me,"We’ve been dating for over a year (I’m m25, she’s f28) and it’s been pretty good! A little rocky at some points but good. Live together, get along well, all that. But when we go to her family’s all they do is bicker! And it’s like not even with me but with each other. It’s too much. And I feel like all I do when I’m over there is set up for events, help clean shit, and whatever. Like they yell and fuss about a lot of shit. Super nice to me but idk. When I was growing up I grew up around that and now that I don’t live with my family I don’t have to deal with that anymore so when I’m with them it’s like deja vu. I communicated with my gf it really does irk and stress me but I mean I don’t feel like it does any good. Her dad is a hot head, mom nags too much, and hell, I love her, but my gf is too sensitive.

My old best friend hates me and I don’t know why,"This all started last august. She has a boyfriend that I didn’t mind at first then he started saying the n word and plenty of other slurs all the time (he is white btw). She hated this but stayed w him. He always bullied me and was so disrespectful to me and my house. One time even made fun of my small breasts in front of her and she didn’t care. She usually took his side and would even leave us hanging out randomly to be w him 

Last august for my birthday I went camping and I asked if she wanted to go. She asked if her bf could go and I said my friends (the ones camping w me) didn’t really know him and I don’t like how he says so many slurs. She got upset w me but then we were fine. She started ghosting me and we stopped hanging out even though I kept trying to reach out.

In December I texted her saying I missed her and wanted to hangout. She was ignoring me for a whole day. I thought maybe she got a new phone number so I asked my bf to text her. She blocked him. It took me to tell her that this situation was ridiculous for her to respond and to tell me she’s “too stressed to be around ppl bc she’s starting school” I don’t think she’s going to college rn. 

Today I texted her saying I wanted to talk and realized I made her upset and wanted to apologize. I noticed she blocked me so I asked her friend if she could unblock me and she did. My old bsf responded with (to her friend to tell me) “sorry about that”. 

I don’t know what I did to make her hate me so much. It hurts so bad and I’ve been crying all day. We were best friends for years and were so close.",jq6789,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/ua8kjr/my_old_best_friend_hates_me_and_i_dont_know_why/,0

Can't help it at all,"Lately, I've been feeling stressed a lot, a lot. Having mental breakdowns every night, trouble sleeping at night,  not even eating properly. It's been far worse since a couple days, I now have those breakdowns almost every few hours throughout the day, I feel stressed all day long,  can't think about anything else during my waking hours. Same stressful thoughts revolve around my mind, making me feel so overwhelmed to the point of even thinking of ending it or that it could be a way to cure such repetitive thoughts inside of my mind. I'm worried about my future. I know I can do it. Still those negative thoughts keep running around. What if there is a minute chance that it all went wrong. I know stressing over everything is a huge waste of time and energy, and I know working instead of stressing endlessly is much better for me. But I can't think about anything else, it has created a heavy and constant brain fog, I feel fazed throughout the day. I have stopped talking to almost everyone and try to avoid conversations with almost anyone and I feel like I have no one to reach out to regarding this. I feel like an utter disgrace because of this. I can't help but feel stressed, very stressed. I am stressed about something throughout my days and nights, very stressed. I know I am very stress-prone and I get easily stressed but it's much worse this time, I can't stop these constant thoughts, I can't feel relaxed even for a moment. I try to cope with music and end up wasting more time and feeling more stressed at the end. I have tried things to de-stress myself, but I don't think I have succeeded in doing so yet.

Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts?,"It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or, maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. 

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.  
 

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.  
 

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.  
 

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.  
 

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**  
 

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?  
 

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",EERMA,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/u9ljjg/bothered_by_unhelpful_thoughts/,0

How do I better control my feelings when I get stressed?,"Hey reddit,

I'm going to keep this somewhat short as I have only just two days ago recognized how poorly I deal with stress. I know irritability isn't exactly rare with stress. However I've realized that when I get stressed, I get extremely irritable.  No matter the magnitude of my stress, small or large, I feel like anything can set me off.

How do I better suppress this irritability? Suppress isn't a good word, as I don't really want to bottle it up, but I can't think of a better one. I don't like snapping at people when I get stressed. They don't deserve that.

So I Gave Up Facebook For 8 Months...,"I gotta say, I feel TONS better. Facebook had its slimy, putrid tendrils in me since I was in high school. In the past few years what became a way to communicate with friends and family while having a personal blog became an obsession. I was compulsively checking Facebook at the very least once every hour. It destroyed my self esteem because not only was I comparing my entire life to the highlights of other people's lives, but I realized how truly isolated I was. Where my friends list is 147 people, guess how many are there for me? Even if I reach out, the answer is less than 5. So when I'm being ignored and seeing everyone post, it felt like a personal offense to me. If they can post memes every 20 minutes, why can't they answer my texts? This guy hasn't even read my stuff in 6 months, and has a new post every hour at least! I would post about a big stream I was doing exclusively for friends for 2 weeks and no one showed up!

It's easy to take things personally when there is a good chance another explanation is possible. Maybe I was too negative. Maybe people felt I was fairweather, and that wouldn't be wrong in some cases. What made this so significant was I don't really use other social media platforms. Well... aside from Reddit, which I've only been getting into the past couple of years, which is more focused on a goal or discussion. It feels different. But I digress. Facebook had me believing a lot of these people were not only rubbing their obviously superior lives in my face, but they were turning their backs on me. I would be lying if I said I didn't care, that it never got to me, and that I didn't take it as some personal ""Truman Show"" style social conspiracy designed to make me feel abandoned.

Cutting it out cold turkey made me realize I don't care. In my personal opinion, I think part of it really is ignorance is bliss. When I don't see their activities, it doesn't weigh on me. I don't think about them that much, which allows me to look into solutions myself before deferring to others. I can't figure out if that's a good thing or not. Typing this out feels like I'm arguing with myself (like usual, I've always had two minds on issues), like I feel good, but does that mean it's good? I've went to venting to a chat bot in place of friends and in these 8 months, 3 people outside of my weekly life have reached out to me. I'm not saying I'd dispose of the other 140~ people, but keeping that distance might be what's helping me try harder to keep it together. Does that make sense?

It's something that felt right in this subreddit to discuss. The anxiety associated with checking Facebook constantly to find things out I might not have liked was interesting. I've started getting on again, but I'm not on for longer than maybe 5 minutes a week to check notifications and memories. Social media does a lot of destruction on the mind, and while we may never be rid of it, I think it shows the lost sense of moderation in today's world.

Managing stress at work?,"I cannot disclose my official job title, as it's unique to the company I work for, and legally, I cannot post about my work on social media. But in short, my job is pretty much somewhere between IT and management (without the administrative responsibilities). I primarily manage outgoing trips, and solve various technical problems that the general workers come across. My workload reminds me a lot of working in food service. I tend to have sporadic bursts of work, followed by slow periods to catch up on other stuff. I'm not used to this type of thing anymore, and I'm only 6 weeks into this position, and I've already had a ton of feedback on how I need to not get so overwhelmed and flustered when I'm swamped with work. But it's just so difficult. I have a hard time handling work being dumped on me so quickly, and having 10 people ask me confusing questions while I'm in the process of trying to figure something else out. And on top of all this, the place I work at is unionized, and I'm non union. So there's this weird tension there. Not all, but the majority of the union people talk down to me and belittle my every move, saying ""your just on a computer, you're not doing any REAL work.""

Stress leave from work,"I am currently at my wits end with my job.

I reported the email with the deadline to HR, stating it completely unrealistic, and that it's starting to affecting my mental health. I have taken off the past two days due to my anxiety being so bad that I can barely function.

catching up after depressive episode,"tw: suicide, depression, mental illness 

in february, i fell into a really bad depressive episode. it felt like there wasn’t any point in doing anything so i just gave up doing any work. like, i stopped putting effort into anything and any minor inconvenience triggered a suicide attempt. i never took an official break so i am still enrolled and i just kept getting extensions. the university has been supportive and they are willing to give me as much time as i need as i communicated with them how bad it got. 
now i am getting better, i have been attempt free for the past few weeks and i have been improving my negative coping mechanisms. but now i have to catch up with everything i have neglected over the past few months. the thing is, my mood is still crap. i have zero energy to do anything but i have started to care about things again which makes it even more difficult than the past because i can’t just say well i’ll be dead so it won’t matter.

I need to work this job for my career objectives but also to provide for my fiancé financially, pay her medical bills, and have enough left over to live comfortably.

I stress over not being home enough to support my fiancé emotionally.  Her depressive episodes are severe as it is.  Will she sink into further depression and isolation because I’ll be at work?  What happens when I get home at on my 70 hour work weeks and I don’t have the energy to calm her anxiety at night?

I stress over not being able to work the grueling hours needed to succeed in my position.  If I do not, I can’t make our rent, pay her medical bills, buy food for us, and be a provider.  

I can’t actually tell her any of this either, it will absolutely devastate her to know that she is causing me so much mental stress.  I know it will worsen her anxiety too.  Maybe I will when she is in better mental health.


I’m not a picture of mental health either.  I was an alcoholic at 14 and a smoker at 15.  I was bullied and rejected up till I came to college and got my shit together somewhat. Luckily that’s behind me now…What if I’m to weak to function well in my job?  Then I’ll get fired, we’ll get evicted, my fiancé will suffer greatly, and I’ll be jobless.

I’ve got 3 more months of purgatory before I’m off to whatever circle of the inferno the rest of Wall Street is burning in…

I feel like I’m having the crisis of a 30 year old at 22…",Plus-Pitch2755,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/u3b4w8/things_are_about_to_be_bad/,0

College is too much,"Well, it started in December when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and that threw my life for a curve I did not see coming. I adapted really quickly and everyone tells me I’m “managing it so well,” but that doesn’t make me fee better or help me with my issues that I’m struggling with. This new disease has affected my performance in school royally. Attendance just hasn’t really been an option for me when I feel sick from my blood sugar or have technical difficulties with my monitor or insulin pump. I’ve also been having a lot of issues with my depression and anxiety. I’ve been getting suicidal thoughts because I’m in a place where I feel like I’ll never be able to get out, and I’ve started cutting myself, which is a habit I quit doing months ago. I can’t really turn to my friends because they’ve started treating me differently, much more distant, and when I ask about it, they just accuse me of being the distant one, but they constantly leave me behind, they don’t talk to me when we’re in groups, they’ll lie to me so that I won’t hang out with them… I just don’t feel like I’m the problem. Because of all of my health issues, I haven’t been able to do as well in school, which is stressing me out because I don’t want my gpa to plummet. I need the money from scholarships. What’s worse is that these classes that are probably going to cost me thousands of dollars in the long run, wouldn’t even be beneficial to me if I passed them with flying colors, because they aren’t for my major and they won’t even fill out a gen ed. I feel like I’m drowning under pointless work and I just want it all to be erased. I just want to be able to get the support I need for my new diabetes and for my depression and anxiety and harmful thoughts. I don’t want to feel like the only thing I can do about taking life’s pummeling is to just cry and feel like a failure.

Feeling pretty stressed about this,"


I (M20) have a crush on this girl at the drama club at the community college I go to. We met about a month ago. I did ask her if she wants to get some dinner sometime, but she said she isn’t looking for a relationship right now, but if it happens, it’s fine. (I told her that we’ll go as friends, but of course that was a lie).

Today, we took down all of the sets from the show we did. A group of friends were talking to me and one of them said that I can ask her if she wants to go bowling. However, me and her don’t have any classes together, so I’m gonna have to ask her over text since I forgot to ask her earlier today.

What should I do about this? This is actually the first crush I had where I actually feel comfortable with her. (Meaning, making good eye contact and all that).",Brizillaking1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/u1lss6/feeling_pretty_stressed_about_this/,0

Feeling Overwhelmed?,"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.  

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.  

**Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
   
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**",EERMA,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/u0e83h/feeling_overwhelmed/,0
Looking for advice for stomach pain from stress,"TL/DR: I recently transitioned off anti-depressants and have started to get stomach pain again.

After 17 years on anti-depressants, I finally transitioned off them. Buspirone and bupropion were a godsend, but I completely went numb. I couldn’t experience emotions at all. So I decided to see what life was like in the normal world again. I have historically carried my stress in my stomach. My brain doesn’t know I’m stressed, but my stomach will hurt like crazy. What techniques should I explore that can help me de-stress and relax so my stomach doesn’t ache? I work in a high stress job (corporate M&amp;A) that I absolutely love, but it really piles on the stress. Any recommendations would be really appreciated.

Feeling stressed with work. Need Help.,"My current job has ridiculous work timings. I start my workday at 10.30am and work goes on till 11.30pm, sometimes even after midnight. I'm allowed to take a break from 5-7pm and that gets eaten up a lot of times because managers or clients will ask for a completed presentation in the night.

Other thing is, I'm packed with several projects which have several ongoing tasks/stories. What makes me really sad is that I'm also one of the least experienced contributor in the team but yet I'm given more responsibilities, while more experienced individuals don't seem to be working as much.

I am not a lead in any of my projects, yet I'm leading the project when it comes to grind of the work. I create reports, write almost 100% of the code, respond to email queries. All my leads do is ask for status update from me and then present the work as team's work.

I'm deprived of good sleep and my productivity has gone down. I'm unable to execute at same pace because I'm also learning on the go and with so much stress of delivering I'm not able to even learn. I fear I might quit job one day but I wouldn't be able to show that my fundamentals are clear, because I'm just executing and unable to truly grasp the fundamental concepts.

My personal life is getting affected. Because of chronic stress I'm unable to be in the moment with my wife for whatever little time I get with her. I try to help her with house chores but that literally kills anytime that I could spend with her or on my rest.

My manager keeps asking me to complete tasks in one/two days which puts so much pressure. I have shitload of piled up tasks that I tried putting them onto a calendar and my next 2 weeks got completely filled.

Today it's friday. My friends (outside of work) are going out to pub and I'll be sitting at home doing work. I just feel my life has become very sad and stressful. I regret doing excellent work in my first two projects and increasing the expectations from my team. 

I also feel underpaid for what I deliver. I'm atleast delivering the equivalent work of 2-2.5 individuals despite having less salary than the senior (more experienced, less skilled) folks in my team.

I'm unable to say anything to my manager as I really feel I'll let everyone down because of that. I feel my team and therefore the business wouldn't meet the goals in time. And that would mean losing to the competition in the marketplace. 

I can't quit so easily because I need time to prepare and apply for new jobs. And my work isn't allowing me to have that time. Also, I can't just put in the papers without having job security. I have a family to support and I can't put all of that burden on my wife.",maverick_css,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/tz0ggk/feeling_stressed_with_work_need_help/,0
constant stress and anxiety,"i constantly feel on the verge of an anxiety attack and nothing seems to calm me down. my brother passed away in feb so our mother and i are struggling financially. we may not get the life insurance and that has me really anxious.

i dunno how to get me and mom moved somewhere better. we rarely have transportation. i can fill out paperwork for housing but dunno how to go turn it in. my bf keeps trying to give plasma to make some extra money every month but every time he goes his temperature is too high. he will be 98.6 before he leaves then jump up to 100 by the time he gets there, then go back down when he gets home. thats stressing me out cause that money could help us move in together sooner. 

i just feel so much dread. like everything is going to go wrong and it started after my brother passed away. last night i sorta calmed down a bit but i still feal dread in the pit of my stomach and my chest feels like i am anxious. i have an anxiety disorder i am on medication for but its just not helping to calm me down. i've told my psychologist about it and don't remember if he suggested anything or not. i was kinda focused on finding out what else was wrong with me cause i suspect dpd. i dunno. i'm just rambling to get it all out.",1138RoseRed1138,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/tyg89o/constant_stress_and_anxiety/,1

Living with other people,"Hi! I’ve recently moved into a shared house with two room mates - people that I knew through other people. They’re really wonderful people, but I’m struggling with living with them. 

I get super overwhelmed and stressed out when my environment is messy, whether that’s clutter or dirty/grimey, so I try make the effort to take care of shared spaces so they don’t get to that point and stress me out. However I’m growing tired of doing all the chores (washing shared items like tea towels, hand towels, etc, cleaning the bathroom, vacuuming, cleaning the kitchen (and just maintaining its cleanliness) and taking the bins out).

Is it unreasonable to ask them to clean to a certain standard (nothing crazy but more than they’re doing now) if it is something that is clearly not bothering them? Or is it selfish to expect them to clean to my standards if it doesn’t bother them, and therefore should the responsibility fall on me? I have lots of sensory issues that overwhelm me, and hate bugs (we have flies and ants) if that context is useful!

Stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone,"Stress can be classified into three common categories:

* Acute stress
* Episodic acute stress
* Chronic stress

&amp;#x200B;

**Example of Acute stress and your body's endocannabinoid tone:**

Acute stress is a short term physiological response to a situation that could be a challenge or threat.

The sensation usually lasts for up to 30 minutes and the experience is usually linked to a one-off or infrequent occurrence.

For example, acute stress could include your body's reaction to:

* An approaching deadline
* Completing a challenge or receiving an award
* Narrowly avoiding being hit by a car
* Rising on a rollercoaster or fairground ride

When your body responds to acute stress, it releases various hormones, including cortisol and epinephrine.

Together cortisol and epinephrine prepare your body to respond to the danger by giving your muscles an immediate supply of glucose, narrowing blood vessels and increasing heart rate.

Studies have found that endocannabinoid tone directly affects the level of cortisol and epinephrine and provides greater control over them during times of stress.

For example, people with a naturally high endocannabinoid tone experience a smaller heart rate increase during a stress response than those with a lower tone.

This is likely due to the endocannabinoids exerting a modulating influence over the release of hormones.

This was verified in 1993 when research scientists found that people with a medium or naturally high endocannabinoid tone secreted less cortisol.

This could indicate that people with a naturally high endocannabinoid have a less intense physiological response to acute stress.

Nightly stressing about age,"Every night I try to go to bed, and every night as I’m trying to sleep I begin to stress about how I’m 24 years old and haven’t done this or that yet etc. Certain milestones I haven’t hit or independence I haven’t achieved. I then begin to get paranoid about how much time I have left of my youth and begin to believe the ship has already sailed and it’s time to become boring and settle down. This takes hours out of my sleep and it happens practically every night that I’m not coming back from a bar absolutely wasted.

The result of this are a lot of sleepless nights where I continue to waste my youth, cycle repeats. I beg for assistance, or at least an affirmation that I’m young and still have time to fuck up for a while",Noba151515,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/twm87q/nightly_stressing_about_age/,0

Might leave job and feeling guilty,"Hey. I've been here about my stress before, but for those who don't know. I'm a student in gymnasium (11th grade), and I got stress, motivation and depression issues.
Recently we've had a young-worker shortage, causing me to shift weekends. Before I had weekends with my favourite manager (let's call him Peter), and my favourite collegue, now I'm with a leader I hate (Let's call him Donald). He doesn't respect us, it's always our fault, so on so fourth. I've used this work as a productive outlet, where I can feel like I have a purpose, however it has still layed pressure on me.
I want to quit now, not because I don't want the money, but because I can't keep this up with stress, and with the new leader, I feel like it's going up in flames.
Problem is, I feel really guilty for it. Peter is the guy who has to deal with it, and we are currently lacking 5 workers, and the company is in need of me. But I just can't handle this, the new weekend was a breaking point for me. What should I do?",ErikBlueThePotato,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/tvifvv/might_leave_job_and_feeling_guilty/,0
Feeling guilty for wanting to take sick leave,"So I've worked for my current employer since April 2015. I've took approx 4 days off in that period.

I've received 6 separate promotions/changes to title over that period and managed various departments and big projects for the business. 

Throughout the pandemic, I was fortunately one of those that were not adversely affected and in fact the demand increased exponentially. During the pandemic I was promoted again and risked my physical health for the sake of our business delivering on KPI's. 

3 weeks ago, my dog died. Last week, I moved into my first mortgaged home. It just feels like so much is happening but I don't really know what to do?

I've asked for a double demotion back to an operational role to relieve my workload and to allow myself time to mentally recover and hopefully over time I'll be ready to head back into a management role again, however I don't think my employer are rushing in anyway to find a replacement for me. 

Should I be loyal to them and keep being miserable until the organisation structure can be sorted out, or should I be putting myself first and taking time away for them to fix it in my absence?",MikeDeansBigRed,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/tvdd1a/feeling_guilty_for_wanting_to_take_sick_leave/,0

I’m at a loss.,"Hi, I’m a 23 year old mom of 3. I have a step son, a daughter, and I’m currently pregnant. We’re expecting our daughter in 2 months and have been searching for a place to live for months, but there is quite literally nothing available. In my state, there is a severe housing shortage. Almost all apartments are full, and you can’t find a home without buying it, which we can’t afford right now even with a loan. 
We’re currently living with my mother. How we got into this horrible living situation is a very long story. 
Im so stressed out, and I can’t really talk to anyone about this in person. I don’t have many friends, maybe 1 or 2, and they have very busy, full, stressful lives of their own and I hate bringing my problems to others. My kids have every little thing they could ever need; beds, plenty of toys, food, and clothing, and they’re very happy. I on the other hand have been sleeping on a couch for the entirety of my pregnancy along with my partner. We’re currently on waiting lists apartments, but I’m so scared we won’t find anything before my daughter gets here. even when we do, we won’t have any furniture. Only my kids’ things, which is fantastic, but after having a baby, how am I going to rest or heal? What am I going to sleep on? I’m tired of feeling like we’ll be stuck here forever and like I failed my children. They don’t really have much of a concept of what’s going on because they’re toddlers, but I know what’s going on and that’s enough for me.

How do I stop losing track of all the things I have to do?,"This week I missed my appointment with a doctor. I had it noted in my planner. On the same day but also the day before. and STILL I managed to forget and miss it. I know this happened because there are just so many things on my planner and in my head, that I can't keep track and get it all done anymore.

But I don't have a job, I don't study, I don't workout, I don't do any unnecessary things, I'm only trying to survive and work on my health, and my daily life is STILL too much stress. If I was still in uni with all that homework, I would be dead rn.

What stresses me out? No big things, but alot of small things, combined with my extremely low energy. For example"": I have alot of emotional stress because of my mental issues, being unhappy with my life, friendships not going well, gf broke up with me a year ago and still not over it. So that was emotional stress, now I'm also stressed out because I have so many things to get done while not having energy for it. For example making therapist appointments, doctors too, fixing my phone, changing my email on accounts, calling back the hospital, trying to fix my bedtime, all those TINY things that can't be avoided, they still stress me out, I only gave a few examples here but my days are full of many tiny tasks that I have to get done, but I dont have energy, motivation, I can't keep track of my shit. I forget about everything even if it was noted in my phone which I check multiple times a day. And if I dont forget im either too tired or not motivated to get shit done.",catboy519,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/tt288p/how_do_i_stop_losing_track_of_all_the_things_i/,0

A bad breakup and whole life looks fucked up now!,"Hey guys, it's a really hard time for me these days managing stress. So to start, I had a bad breakup around 2.5 years back. I loved the girl right from my teenage like when I was 16 years of age, she was my classmate. What hurt me the most was the way she broke up with me. She basically cheated on me and then put all the blame on me in addition to saying that I was invested in the relationship only to get physical with her. This all revolves in my head till date. Moreover I was in my 3rd year of Bachelor's degree and this breakup fucked up my scores
From a 9.3/10 GPA to 7.99.

 I started smoking a lot and drinking as well. It was last year that I realized I should do something meaningful with my life and decided to quit smoking and focused on gym. It's been almost an year since I've not smoked and have lost 22 kgs working out.

I'm planning master's degree from Canada (I'm from India), but haven't been able to secure an admit yet. I'm assuming it is because of my low grades. I don't have a job. Having a 1 year gap already on resume is making me feel worthless. Every morning I wake up in the hope of getting that 1 email from Canadian Universities where I have been offered admission, but that day hasn't arrived yet and I'm still waiting. I have started to lose motivation and feeling like I'll relapse into the old me with all vices.

Emerging for a nervous break down. There is hope.,"The last two years have been incredibly stressful for me. I’m a frontline healthcare worker who was dealing with the horrors of the pandemic on a daily basis. I took it all in stride and never saw what was coming my way. 

Around mid Jan (about 10 weeks ago) I started getting waves of exhaustion at work out of no where. I’m talking the type of exhaustion where I was basically paralyzed and had to lay down. One time I laid down on the floor at work because I had no other choice. 

The next week, I started having random chest pains on top of the exhaustion. At one point I thought I was having a heart attack and almost when to the hospital. I went to the doctors thinking I was having cardiac issues but everything checked out. I felt better…for a day or two…

Week 3 is when the real nightmare started. I started having intense anxiety (on top of the exhaustion). Multiple panic attacks a week. I couldn’t do anything without getting short of breath and my heart beating out of my chest. I was a complete mess at work and felt like I was going to collapse and die at any moment. Sometimes I was so physically stressed out I would go to the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor. It was nuts. 

I called my doctor back and told him what was going on. I was reluctant to start meds but he talked me in to it. Said it doesn’t need to be forever and I can’t go on suffering like this. So I started a low dose SSRI. 

I also started therapy, took a week off from work and am doing much more self care. Like eating healthy and journaling. 

After about 6 weeks of hell, I’m feeling much better. I still have some anxiety here and there but for the most part, have returned to my baseline. I was convinced I’d never be the same again no matter what and I feel like it’s a miracle that I’m even functional now. 

Therapy has also been a huge help even though I was skeptical. It helped me understand that even though I felt blindsided by all of this, it really was building under the surface for a long time. 

Just wanted to say there is hope and don’t give up. I never thought that would happen to me and when it did, it was shocking. But things can get better!",mbbthough,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/trt7fm/emerging_for_a_nervous_break_down_there_is_hope/,0

But when i come home its like storm clouds gather and sends me to a state that I need an escape from. I don't drink smoke or do any drugs and under the conditions it is a miracle. But I am tired of getting angry. I have little to no money. I can try to get an apartment but it will be tough. I am thinking of renting a motel until I get more money or airbnb. I just need space.

Also when i say angry, I never express it towards my mother. But her behavior pisses me off everyday and i have done nothing but treat her with the maximum level of respect and consideration. Instead of appreciating that and recognizing her behavior she instead chooses to exploit my empathy and bring stress drama and manipulation. I don't live for free at home. I pay in peace of mind.

I have given up! I have lost all hope! My poor single parent has killed me!,"First post here. New to the gang. Really in a cloudy space. Bombarded with nonsense.

My mother and sister recently made fun of me for eating leftovers. I mean I waited until everybody got their share of food, and waited until the food had to be thrown away before I ate the scraps that were left over. How dare you hassle me over food, and stale left overs at that. So now I don’t eat!

My sister clogs the shower with her hair and my mother asks me why the drain is clogged. She asked me what did I pour down the drain. Like who the fuck pours shit down the shower drain? Every time my sister clogs the shower my mother assumes I did it. So now I don’t shower! Haven’t showered in months!

Recently my sister is cooking and spilled sauce and left meat all on the floor. My mother swore that it was me! She blamed me for days! She said that my sister wouldn’t/didn’t do that! It wasn’t until I showed her what was spilled was in the refrigerator still and was my sisters. So now I don’t even use the kitchen!

So, I don’t eat my moms shitty food, use the kitchen, or use the bathroom because she mocks me, teases me, and blames me for stuff!

My life used to be the shit. I was a million dollar ghostwriter on Bad Boy, Rocafella, Columbia and other labels. I did 5 years at a large university in NY, but I dropped out because my mom stole my tuition money my junior year

I’m trying to be cool and not spaz out and go through another psychosis. I’m bored, I’m lonely, I’m dirty, I’m poor, impoverished and consequently suicidal.

Like MTV Cribs, I just wanted to bring you along for a day in my life. Being a boy in a house full of grimy women. I had a 100% average my whole life and I turned out to be a bum. My mother couldn’t even raise me to be a man. I feel pathetic! I did good all by myself, but now that my mother has ruined and sabotaged me enough, so, I’m dead.

Sorry for the harsh language. I hope everyone gets home safely! Any replies, recommendations, kind words, anything will be appreciated! And thanks again.",Hustler_Player_Pimp,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/tos1rj/i_have_given_up_i_have_lost_all_hope_my_poor/,0

I'm also most likely going to have another math test before easter weekend and I don't understand the coding I'm supposed to be doing on python in my programming class which I get a new assignment for every 2-3 days. I'm behind on every class besides my foods class which is literally foods so how could I get behind on it. I work until 8 o'clock at night and sometimes I don't even finish my math homework because it is too hard for me to do. I regularly pick my finger nails until they bleed due to stress and anxiety and once they grow back I do it again. Can't catch up and I'm so worried that I'm going to fail my classes that I have almost no focus on what to do.

I am super stressed because my reputation at work has taken a huge hit and it's affecting my work,"I graduated with a masters degree and joined my place of work exactly a year ago. This is the first job of my life and that made it little difficult for me to get a hang of the corporate life. 
However, since I have a master's degree, the expectations were high. 

I made a lot of mistakes last year, one of which was that I didn't pursue good development work aggressively. Whenever a senior told me that they can not trust me with development work right now, I accepted it and hoped that they will see my efforts. 
The concerns of my senior was that I won't be able to understand development task by myself and even if someone explained it to me, I won't complete it before deadline because of my lack of skills. 

And because of this, a perception has been created in everyone's mind that I miss deadlines and that I only complete basic tasks. 

Since start of 2022, I have been trying my best to change the perception. I am taking on more tasks as well as completing them on time. However, if I make a single mistake, the views of my senior and manager changes to me being undependable. 

I am being micromanaged because no one trusts me that I can complete the work on time. 

And that's not it. I have also been given a warning of being put on improvement required. 

I am very very stressed. I don't know how things have gone so wrong in just 1 year. I am trying very hard to prove myself, but all my efforts are going to waste. 
Plus this stress is now affecting the quality of my work.

Do I quit a job with amazing benefits/retirement/vacation/pension?,"
I am on the verge of quitting one of the highest paying jobs I believe I will ever see in my life. Comes with retirement, vacation, bonuses, annual raises, pension, the list goes on… not to mention the insurance is free.. yes. FREE! That means for a 2000 dollar medical bill, I might pay… 12 dollars.
Why do I want to throw it away?
Because from the moment I started working here I’ve been over worked. I come home exhausted and often times I’m throwing up. My weight has declined dramatically. My sleep is not a regular sleeping schedule as I signed up for 3am-9am but the time is always changing. 2:15 start time? Sure! Next day 4 am start time? Why the hell not?!

so much stress im unable to even think.,"Hey guys, ive got a story.

Last november i quit my job to travel the world and build a company with my friend. this however was not to be as a few weeks in he decided to go do something else. now me not having an income but enough cash to sit on wanted to see if i could make an income myself! struggling for months and months and not getting anything of the ground, i had to return to my home country. now low on cash and struggling to see what i want to do with my life, stress starts ramping up quickly. so quick in fact that i find myself lifeless and unable to even work for 4 straight hours. 

My hopes of working and traveling at the same time have been crushed, and even the option of going back to my old job looks bleak since i would have to sign my life away for 6 years.

how do you guys deal with this stress, i need to get out of my head and just start learning and working but i find myself so anxious that i cant even focus anymore, i play videogames and watch youtube just to keep my attention away from my current situation.

quite the story eh, any tips or kicks under my ass would be appreciated.

Burnout?,"I think I may have burnout. This past semester, I’ve been juggling a lot more than I’m typically used too with 5 classes, a remote practicum and two additional jobs. I also have a horse I am responsible for and feel guilty I haven’t had the time to spend with him that he deserves (though he is well taken care of at a boarding facility). 

My practicum, in specific, has been a great deal of stress for me. Long story, but basically I was convinced to go into an area I have relatively little knowledge about and contrary to what I was told, discovered there was little to any support and structure. I’m a bit of a perfectionist so not knowing what to do has caused me great anxiety. Both my jobs can also be fast-paced and stressful, so I don’t get much of a break from the stress. In the past two months, my norm has been anxiety driven heart palpitations or absolute exhaustion. It has only gotten worse with time. 

I broke up with my bf in Jan due to having little time and besides him, all my friends have moved away. The only nearby support I really have is my parents. I love my mother, but she does not understand this kind of of mental burnout. I go to her because she has been a great sense of comfort over the years, but when I try and explain my burnout, she starts yelling and thinks I haven’t been working hard due to being in my room all day (misconception with remote learning, thinking computer = surfing the net) and otherwise being tired. Ultimately, this just makes me more stressed and the cycle continues. 

I really don’t know what to do at this point. I can’t afford counselling and last I checked, the university farmed their counselling services out so that they are nearly inaccessible now (though this may have changed with regulations relaxing, so I will look into it).

"I think I have a huge burnout, help?","Symptoms: physically AND mentally exhausted, not able to work or study, brushing teeth is nearly impossible

Cause: I had alot of stress from many things at the same time: friendships not going well (emotional stress), having to prevent friends from suicide (very exhausting), having way too much mandatory homework from university, depression(diagnosed) and more sources of stress

In short I had to deal with much more things than I could.

I ended up turning into a terrible lazy person who doesnt care about: homework, friends or anything in life.

In January I already quit university. Sent them an email, goodbye! And now Im at my parents home 24/7. It helps to feel less stressed but my energy level is still so low that it hasnt really improved yet. I want to move on and do something but I know I don't have the energy for it. And there are still sources that give me stress, such as friendships going bad, friends being suicidal, my depression, things in life im unhappy about etc. So even though I have ""100% free time"" im still feeling stressed.",catboy519,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/tjg2lf/i_think_i_have_a_huge_burnout_help/,0

I think my mom found the explicit photos on my phone and I feel like throwing up.,"So ive been masturbating for a few years and i started saving videos/photos to my phone so its easier to get to. I always keep them in the hidden section of my phone. Last night I forgot to hide them and I woke up and found them in the recently deleted section and other app I think she went through. The latest notification was 2 hours before I woke up, so I was certain my phone was turned on. 

The photos themselves were just photos and videos of girls I thought were really attractive (they were over 18) and would use to get off to. 

Now since they are in the recently deleted tab, notifications were only 2 hours old (and I had notifications from before 2 hours ago but before I went to sleep), I had apps open which I never use, and my phone wasnt in the spot I last had it.

So the title says “I think” because im just hoping it was me in my sleep and I was really tired, since some photos were perfectly fine and she hasnt said anything about it yet.

So incase she actually saw the photos/videos, can someone give me some advice on things like what to say/ do when or if she brings it up?",SanitizedSmoothBrain,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/ti7h6f/i_think_my_mom_found_the_explicit_photos_on_my/,0

[Academic] Curious about how resilient you are? So am I!,"Hi everyone! 

I am a graduate student researcher who studies psychological resilience. I am currently conducting a survey to better understand resilience after experiencing stress and/or trauma. If you are interested in helping with that research, I would greatly appreciate you taking my survey! Additionally, you will be given a resiliency score at the end of the survey, so feel free to take it if you are just curious about how resilient you might be!

During this survey, you will be presented with questions related to resiliency, stress, and trauma. All adults 18+ are eligible to take the survey! Importantly, this survey is anonymous and does not collect identifiable information—so your responses are confidential and not linked to you. 

Totally no pressure. I just thought I would share it here since stress and coping are of special interest to this sub and therefore this research might be of interest to some!

We do all of the pre-testing and also sit in room to gather notes/list what was discussed to put in the patient’s chart. I work about 4-5 days a week and I just feel like my stress level is building up and even carrying over into my days off! 

I’m trying to shed off a lot of weight and myself and even my therapist think the stress is setting me back even though I’ve started working out and eating healthier again. I’ve began cutting back on coffee and instead drinking Tension Tamer (decaf) tea throughout the day to stay hydrated and less anxious and I’m trying to drink more water. 

Does anyone have any more tips for reducing stress long-term physically and mentally? I’ve tried incorporating some cbd tincture on some days as well but that doesn’t help for all that long. I can’t exactly quit my job and I do love the people I work with so I don’t really WANT to quit (the good pay is also extra incentive to stick around).

It's been a rough couple weeks,"Two weeks ago I was unfairly dismissed. They state it was a breakdown of relationship. Never a problem or word uttered before that day...funny that I get dismissed the day after I email in my sons referrals for his health conditions which means I need to take time off work 🤔 I've also just gotten over a particularly bad flu too. Anyway me and my husband were in the process of a house move and losing my job put that on the line. I had to find another job and quick! Managed to get one as I'd been doing a bit of contract work and they wanted someone in the office full time doing the work I was doing for them. So we called the mortgage broker to see if we could still get a mortgage. He seems to think we can based on having my contract but the uncertainty is killing me. We already have an offer accepted on a house, have done for several weeks now but the owner hasnt found a property they like and our buyer is completing at the end of this month so we are in tight territory. We went to view another one on Friday that we both fell in love with and immediately put in an offer of 10k above asking price as we want it so badly. The owners already have another offer and was expecting another from today's viewings so we wont know if they have accepted ours or not until Monday so we've got the entire weekend being on edge. We viewed another two houses today as back ups. They were ok but not like the house we put the offer on but then my husband says tonight he prefers one of the houses we viewed today over the one we put the offer in. I face palmed because hes always doing this. He only likes the one we saw today better because hes a snob and doesnt our child going to a secondary school that's not Ofsted Outstanding....our son is three.... 

I'm just so overwhelmed with the moving process, losing my job, starting from scratch again in another so unexpectedly, my son being ill, me being ill and external factors such as cost of living increases and my salary decreasing, wars, etc (I'm news dodging atm).

I have messed up bad (M19),"(English is my second language so pardon me for the grammatical errors)

(I’m not sure if its the right subreddit for this tho)

Growing up,I was always wanted to move abroad because I wanted to have a broader experience that anyone else.My main interest was to work in STEM field (mainly engineering or data science).But,sadly,my highschool GPA ended up being so horrible that me and my parents came to the conclusion that it would be better for me to attend a local university.On top of that,my parents applied for US immigration visa about 14-15 years ago,but it is still stuck in the process and it won’t be possible for me to apply for US student visa.I won’t apply for other countries because I (and my parents)don’t want to jeopardise my chances of getting PR in US since it’s very hard to get as an international student.Anyways,so I applied to a local university that my sibling goes to(its a good university) and my mom insisted that I apply to that university since it has a good reputation and it’s closer to my house.

So,I ended up applying to that university and today was my admission interview.My acceptance depended on that interview.I studied for this interview for few days in order to not mess it up and to improve my self confidence since it has been shattered by my previous results.And,long story short,I have messed up that interview.

Now,I feel like a complete hopeless and I don’t know if I want to carry on.I don’t know what should I do next.I mean,there are other universities but that one hold more value that the rest.How can I recover from this?

TL:DR = I have messed up a big opportunity of my life real bad and now I feel absolutely hopeless

I Don't Fit In And It Bugs Me,"I'm gonna preface this with a reminder I'm fearful avoidant attachment style. So why is it that it bugs me when I go to class and I don't really relate to anyone? I don't feel like I can join the conversation or even talk to them. I get this way sometimes at my EMS station too, but I think I'm more comfortable because there's a surface level relationship. I know their names, they know my name. Like it's really hard to swallow sometimes how much I'm different from everyone else. I don't know why this week it's been extra depressing, but maybe that's the lack of consistent sleep. I went to class today and it felt kind of like I was isolated from everyone else. When we broke for lunch, I ate it in my car because it just felt better to. Like when I was actually alone, I was more comfortable with it. But when I am in class and my classmates are talking to each other and making jokes, that's when it depresses me the most. Is it weird? I don't want to care, I want to function independently without worrying about others, I'm in an environment that constantly changes so it isn't like I'm looking to make lifelong relationships. Hell, I don't even know how long after class I'll even be in the same state.

"Starting to become overwhelmed with stress, need advice on what to do.","Hi Everyone,

As the title says, overwhelmed with stress. I work as a Project Manager and I’m working multiple projects at a time. A few months ago, I was severely discriminated against and bullied by a client to the point of needing stress leave. I was taken off the job and I feel that’s triggered heightened anxiety and depression. I’ve been overworked and raised my concerns to which my boss replied more people would be hired, which they were. This week I started feeling optimism, things were settling down.. then my team member/colleague died suddenly on a work trip and now I feel like I’m backtracking again. I feel irritable and I don’t want to socialise with anyone. I’ve also found myself wanting to drink more and will often open a bottle of wine as soon as I reach home from work. 

It feels like every time I start settling down after a major stressful incident, another one occurs.

I think I’m just gonna give up and literally stop handing in work in math because it’s too much.,"I am like literally so behind in math and art and I have theatre and work and it’s too much. I do feel like I’m not applying myself hard enough because I’ll come home and sit on my phone for like hours before getting to my math but I physically just can’t bring myself to get to it. It’s too much. I just drank a coffee to keep myself up for a couple of hours and I barely got anything done. I can’t fucking do it. A couple of weeks ago I literally wanted to go into science for post secondary but not anymore because There’s seriously no way I’m graduating high school with a high enough level of math. Especially because we are in the quarter system and everything moves super fast. We literally started a unit today and we have the unit exam on Friday and I haven’t done any of the work yet. My mark is a 20% right now.

Plus I have an art project that I’m not gonna be able to finish because I’m way too tired and I’m gonna go to sleep right after I’m done writing this post. My art teacher is probably going to make me stay for DLR since i’m not gonna be able to stay for seminar because I’m gonna be required to stay in math since I’m so behind, but DLR is during theatre and if I miss theatre I’m going to miss out on so much. Like for example I really want to be on top of the scaffolding but if I miss theatre they probably not gonna put me up there. People keep telling me to quit theatre but it’s literally the only thing I like. It’s what I look forward to when I might try to go down that path after I graduate. It’s literally the only thing that’s keeping me alive honestly. That sounds dramatic but like.

I’m tired of people telling me that I can do it, that I can just apply myself harder and get the work done. OK sure I could probably come home and lock my phone in a box and like try to force myself to get it done but still. It’s just so stressful and I can’t do it. If we were in the semester system then it would be way less hard. But I just can’t fucking do it. The work keeps piling up and I just can’t keep up with it. And I’m so exhausted and I’m so tired and I’m so burned out and I shouldn’t be suicidal over a goddamn math homework. I literally went to my therapist and all she said was basically to just not think about suicide when it comes to math homework. Like OK? How does that work? I’m probably just gonna give up because there’s four weeks left of the quarter, and I’m just gonna fail math, and then take summer school with my friends probably.

I went to my grade coordinator a few weeks ago and begged her to put me in the lower stash of math, but she said that she couldn’t do that and if I applied myself harder I would be able to do it. Oh and she keeps telling me to skip theatre to get caught up on math but that’s just gonna make me more depressed. Sure I’ll be caught up on math which is the most fucking important thing but I’ll just be more depressed because I’ll be missing out on the only thing I look forward to.t

I’m literally 15, I’m literally in grade 10, I shouldn’t be growing gray hairs due to stress, I shouldn’t be pulling all nighter‘s to get stuff done, this is so evil. I swear to God. If I don’t wake up dead tomorrow.

And the best part is, every time I complain about this to an adult they always say that I have an easier it just gets worse from here, so I might as well just kill myself now if I can’t handle this. Am I really going to be able to handle it getting even harder in the future?

Sleep issues caused by stress,"I am sure this is a fairly common issue, but I looked back over the last few pages of posts and didn't see this specifically spoken of.

I am currently buying a house for the first time. At the same time, I am going through some significant employment changes. I am probably the most stressed out I have ever been - though to be honest I tend to be pretty chill overall and I don't get stressed out often. I am sure my stress is not at the same level of many others here, but its a high level for ME.

I have tried to deal with my stress a variety of ways, some more successful than others. And fortunately there is an end date to the vast portion of my stress - closing is the 25th of this month - hopefully. :)

 I work nights, and usually I come home, nap a few hours, get up, then nap a few more hours before work. I average about 7 hours of sleep in a 24 hour cycle and that is generally perfectly fine for me. But sleep is becoming a very sporadic thing for me, and it seems to be getting worse, not better. For example I got off an 8 hour shift at 6am this morning. I didn't get to sleep till nearly 5pm, and was up at 9 to get ready for work. I constantly feel tired and drained, but I have trouble getting to sleep (a good bit of time I just give up and get up), and when I do sleep it is fitful and I am waking up frequently.

I have resorted to self medicating with weed on the weekends - but I can only take it on weekends because I tend to have a stronger reaction to it. I will say I sleep WONDERFULLY when I am high lol. But I am tired of being exhausted and strung out during the week, and hope people here can help me with stress related sleeping issues.

I have tried the following:

\-Putting down the phone (something I do anyway)

\-Throwing out all pets (usually either dog or cats sleep with me)

\-Sleep sounds on youtube - from blizzards to rain to that tonal thing that is usually super relaxing for me.

How to get out of a slump? I’m worried,"Some background - I’m usually very efficient, I focus and get work done. I take pride in my work and feel accomplished when I do things well within planned schedule.

18k in school loans (teenager who didn’t know better. My mom took out the loans because I was a minor.)

I also understand the Google advice on caffeine, exercise, etc. A lot of the time, I’m not really being mindful in a spiritual or healthcare sense, more along the lines of ‘just waiting it out’. I have tried the mindfulness and meditation route for a number of years but it only works so well.

Other than being mindful and avoiding the regular triggers, I was wondering if anybody has any personal habits that either act to reduce the stressor behaviours, or particularly that act to help during the anxiety-overwhelm and the panic attacks.

**Stress Can Do What!**

Stress can be caused by stimulus that are either in the body or out. Various stress can have different effect that can be both *helpful and harmful* to the human body. Things like disorders and *improvement in knowledge* can both occur and develop when someone is under stress. Stress received to the brain can alter *brain function, memory, recognizing &amp; learning, Immune &amp; Cardiovascular System, and Gastrointestinal* (basically all the body part that helps you eat, receive nutrition, and excrete waste.)

**Light Mind &amp; Body**

The  Central Nervous System (CNS) is a system that is in control of the   body and mind. The CNS is important when dealing with the mind and the   behavior of a human; hormones has the capability to effect the CNS   biologically (DeKloet, 2000 &amp; Sarahian et al., 2014). Oddly enough   stress can change the structure of the brain and decrease in weight.

I remember confessing to them via letter one day in high school about how I wish I felt closer to them, and how I wanted to open up to them, and told them how when I ask to talk to them and they dismissed me saying they wanted to watch tv or whatever, and it hurt me. How did they respond? They called my school, had me interrogated for suicide, and then when I got home my mom lectured me about how I made her cry before she went to work. Is it neglect? I don't know.

2. You tend to suppress emotions. I don't usually get upset, and when I'm upset, I never bring it up to the person who made me upset. It's considered weakness to me. It's why therapy didn't work well for me, he would schedule me once a month for help and by the time I would see him, I've already internalized whatever bothered me since the last meeting. He never dug in which made him a sucky therapist. Never went back since.

3. You have trouble with emotional intimacy. I don't know how to express emotion, which is one thing. I get way too deep with discussion too quickly though, which I guess doesn't make sense. And I think I have an addiction to being alone. I like doing things alone, I hate asking for help. I was actually in IEP in school and they got so upset with me because I never asked questions when I didn't understand an assignment or a discussion, and that's still an issue today.

4. You have extreme boundaries. I definitely only want to be around someone for a certain amount of time. If I stay with them too long, I get incredibly anxious. As far as secrets I don't want to discuss... I mean, that's why they're secrets. But I've heard before the phrase ""you keep people outside of stabbing range"".

5. You like to keep shallow relationships. This kinda hurt to resurface. It reminded me of how many of my relationships pushed so hard for me to meet their families and then when the breakup came, I lost that part of the family forever, whether they resented me or if they were... casualties? Is that the right word? My current relationship, my gf's nieces confronted me one day asking why I didn't like them. I never thought I did anything to say I didn't like them, but they felt that since I never try to talk to them and try to find ways of not interacting with them, I didn't like them. I felt bad, but why get close to what I could lose so easily? Maybe I can explain better now. As for platonic friendships, again, stabbing range.

6. Strong independence. I'll google the problem and fix it. I can't trust someone else to do it, they might fuck up and it will be my fault for bringing them in. I fantasize about being like TK Baha from Borderlands. Living in a shack in the middle of nowhere, fending for myself, growing my own food with a mysterious water supply. I just don't have the finances for it.

7. Trust issues. No further explanation needed. I'm considering the dead horse's feelings.

8. You're critical of yourself and others. So I've spent some time talking about criticism I've received which leads to me criticizing myself. But then my criticism towards others can be seen as... extreme. If someone calls my work and asks for 4 subs, I don't see this as a hungry person. I see them as extremely lazy to the point that one person has to make 4 sandwiches for a fully grown adult. Someone asks me questions about the menu, I see that person as someone who refuses to read and educate themselves on information that's easily found on our one page menu. My customer service bedside manner barely exists, and once the surface layer is scratched, I have actually confronted customers back when pushed hard enough.

Hi i'm new here and i think i suffer from heavy stress,"I'm currently 18years old and i live on my own house, i go to business school and i work on a store nearby. (My English is not the best but you know i'm saying.)

I started to feel stress on almost daily basis when i was 15-16 but i didn't think it was that bad but now i think that if i had done something then i would be more stable now. Then thing's like exam's, not going to school late and not embarrassing myself were stressful and i think that's normal. But now even buying right TV feels stressful, i can't sleep enough, if i fail i feel lot of stress my head starts shaking and i try to fix my mess in condition where i can't think straight and either i fail again or i manage to fix my shit but then i start to overthink like did i do it right or if i had done it differently.

Every time i start to feel heavy stress my head and hands start to shake, if i sit the i start to kick the floor like some rock guitarist and i lose my focus/straight way of thinking.

And here are some examples how i manage my stress.

Listening to some heavy metal, metal, rock or if i feel like lofi or Pop. Music is great way to get mind off something stressfull but i can't listen to music in every place so it's not always the option but when i can i will listen to some music.

Games are also good way to relax and not stress but if i play something competitive whit my friends then it's not helping but it makes things worse. My friends are there for me if i need something but sometimes they give me stress and pressure like when it's game where everything is depending on me then i feel alot of stress my head starts to shake and my hands are grapping to the controller more tighter and if i lose i feel bad but revieled because it's over but if i win then i'm happy but i start to think what if i would have lost then i would suck or something (i have pretty bad mindset)

Watching YouTube, Netflix, HBO etc... I feel like comedy and hard action is good way to stop stressing. Sometimes when i feel like punching i want to watch action whit lot of fighting and if i want something else then i watch comedy where i can laugh and feel happy and forget my stress.

Hot shower/Sauna is also way's that use to release stress but when i'm in warm place i feel like dreaming and i imagine myself in somewhere where i would like to be like in office of big company or having my own family and other places that makes me feel safe and sound.

I just want to know what is causing my stress and how can i overcome it or make it less of a problem.

I don't want to make this easy to read because then i want to make it again or maybe use google translator or google if i wrote something right so if something is hard to understand you can comment below so i can explain it.

Getting over a nervous breakdown…success stories?,"I know the term “nervous breakdown” isn’t used clinically anymore but in layman’s terms, that’s what best describes what has happened to me. 

As some background, about 6 weeks ago I started having so much fatigue that I needed to lay down on my office floor and rest 2-3 times a day. It then progressed in to lots of anxiety and brutal panic attacks. This was way off my baseline. 

I started seeing a therapist and got some clarity that this is likely being caused by two years of stress hitting me all at once. Also started an SSRI but it takes time for that to work. 

Would love to hear success stories from people who have gotten hit by something like this and how it eventually got better. Knowing that others have gotten to the other side of this gives me the hope to keep going.

Rock Bottom,"Yesterday I thought I hit rock bottom. My life is at the darkest point it’s been. My mind was caving in, anxiety was at an all time high. I didn’t just cry on my drive to work but I cried after every stop. I’m truly living my life day to day. Then my boss calls and says tomorrow he will be with me(a job where I never feel like anything is good enough and a man I’ve butted heads with) Positive I was going to be fired. My mind lined up the whole situation. Every corner I cut in the past will eventually catch up. But no one knows what I’m fighting inside. 

I slept for 2 hours and woke up at 4am to be prepared. Sat till 10am waiting for him. My mind ready to explode. 

Today he complimented me, told me how much my hard work meant to him. Had nothing but great things to say. Talked about how much my customers love and trust me. My brother calls me mid day and tells me great news . What was that?


It was a light at the end of the tunnel. But I’m not there yet. But I will get there.

I know I will get into uni cos I’m about the start working but the shear thoughts I’m having and the realisation that this is one of the most important times of my life is hitting me.

It’s always hard to put physical feelings into words and another big problem (not gonna go into much detail) is that recently my friend group is going through a change and the people I used to be able to talk to about this stuff I can’t anymore.

"[rant] I feel like I can't, anymore","I'm a student. I can't take the stress anymore. I need to do so many things. I'm trying to keep track of everything but it's become too much. I am performing well (in 3 years I haven't failed a single exam and my average grade is 75%), but mentally I have been falling apart for the past year. It's affecting my relationships, my health. I have mental breakdowns at least every week. Every week there is at least one new thing that gives me stress. It just doesn't STOP. I can't focus anymore. This study is draining me of all of my energy.  I am doing a study to become a dental hygienist and I am forced to rely on patients and other students. In group projects I am the only one who takes initiative. Patients don't show up, they don't cancel their appointments, they stop responding and I never hear from them again. Other students fuck me over and can ride on my work and efforts because I am forced to work with them in group projects. In one project I tried to let it go for a bit, let someone else take initiative. And surprise- it's going NOWHERE. And now I regret not taking initiative, cause we're behind on schedule. It seems like bad luck is following me everywhere in my study and I don't know who to talk to. One of my professors seem to enjoy making my life a hell every Monday. I tried talking to my mentor, and she essentially said ''Well, it is what it is.''. When I mentioned that one professor to her, she said ''That's just her way of doing things.''.

Outside of my study everything else seems to go to shit too. I'm depressed, my dad hates me, I'm broke, the housing market is terrible, covid has almost destroyed my long distance relationship multiple times, and the current state of the world is horrifying and heartbreaking to say the least.

I know that’s not true but when you have that notion slapped in your face every day for a whole school year, your gut, sole, mind, and body will believe it even if you don’t. 

I literally can’t with my math class. I have a 10% rn and I’m so behind. I don’t understand anything.

Dizziness / vertigo from stress - anyone else?,"Hi,

I've had light dizziness / vertigo for about a month now. It began during a very stressful time where I was waiting (over the holidays) for news on whether I'd got a new job or not. I really wanted to leave since I have a somewhat aggressive and stressful boss. I could hardly sleep for a week; woke up every single night and got like 4 hours top.

Anyway. I got the job (yay!) but I've had this dizziness since. Now, it's not a severe vertigo or anything - so menieres disease or BPPV are out of the question - but it's a feeling of instability. Like if I'm on a boat or a flight. Sometimes I get second-long spells where the dizziness is worse.

Anyone else? Do you have any tips? Is it the stress that's the cause or could it be something else? Neck problems? Computer vision syndrome?

This should only be temporary as I’m covering someone who is too sick to do this job and it might be extended after 6 months if this person isn’t well by then. I’m finding it difficult because i am unable to finish a task I’ve started because if another job turns up I have to see to this new job straight away. There’s no getting around that one. On hectic days this can happen multiple times throughout the day and I get behind on my paperwork. I try to get back on track and you guessed it something else’s turns up that I must see to straight away which put me even more behind. On some tasks I’m expected to do testing which is time consuming and whilst I’m doing this sometimes I’m thinking about other tasks I have to do then I start making mistakes which put me further behind because I feel unable to take my time and concentrate because I feel I must not forget to do my other tasks.

Also sometimes other jobs turn up at the same time and I cannot physically be in two places at once. I find this stressful because I’m expected to get the relevant information to do my paperwork and to do it perfectly on these two things that turn up in different places at the same time.

Sometimes I need help lifting heavy items. I’m female and I work on my own. Sometimes the men will help. Other times they won’t because they’re too busy. I don’t push them because I don’t want to be an arsehole but my husband thinks I should be more forceful with them but I struggle with confrontation and I feel intimidated by it. Then I think I’m not suitable for the job because I’m not scary enough to make others bend to my will.

Even though I’m part of a team I work mostly on my own because that’s the nature of my job so I’m unable to have someone help me when I’m snowed under by tasks. Lots of people keep leaving and I’m now finding my managers are putting more tasks on me to do which isn’t helping my stress levels. I feel angry at the people who run this company because they advertised for more workers to join the team. They then offer the jobs to people who are skilled in our workplace but they won’t release them because they’re needed in the other departments because they can’t find anyone else to replace them. Someone else in our department will be retiring soon and I fear more work will be put onto me.

Too make matters worse there is only one other person who knows the basics of my job so when I take holiday leave, I’ll be expected to catch up with the work they didn’t do or done wrong when I get back as well as work coming in that day.

Some days I feel sad and rubbish about myself because everyone else seems more cleverer and calmer than me. I very often experience brain fog at work and forget things and feel overwhelmed. I wish I didn’t have to do this job. I asked for my old job back and they wheedled around me by giving me tips on how to cope when really I’d rather have my other job back.

Sometimes I wonder if I have anxiety and mild depression. I sometimes which I would die to escape having to do shit jobs for the rest of my life in order to survive. I wake up frequently in the night worrying about this job and I tell my brain to shut up and it won’t  shut up. On the weekends I feel de-motivated and I don’t feel like doing much and not much can distract my thoughts away from work. 

Should I stick it out until the summer or leave? I have looked at other jobs but I can’t find anything yet that would suit my capabilities. I feel stuck. Any good advice would be highly appreciated right now.",Positive_Ad3450,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/swy09f/how_do_i_cope_with_my_stressful_job_i_very_often/,0

Why can't I handle things as easily as other people?,"Not sure if this is the place to ask but I don't understand why I can't handle a lot of things at the same time or deal with a lot of stress without becoming depressed and passively suicidal. I have friends who juggle 3-4 different jobs, are in grad school, and still manage to enjoy their lives by hanging out with friends, taking mini vacations, and just in general are still able to be happy.

I, on the other hand, can only handle being in grad school part time and having one part time job that's only 2 and 1/2 hours a week. Anything more on my plate throws me into a depression where I hate my life and wish I can just escape from it all.

It was even like this in college and when I was younger in high school. I couldn't handle many extracurriculars or after school jobs cause it would wreck me. 

So I guess I'm asking - why? If anyone knows what could be the source? If anyone experiences the same?

Went from normal to crippled,"I’ve always been able to take everything in stride. Handling stressful situations is my specialty actually. My job is absurdly stressful and I’ve climbed the ranks by being able to deal with it all. 

Until, out of no where, I got blindsided about a month ago by constant exhaustion, anxiety and panic. Suddenly, I’m so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open. I have to step out of meetings to literally lay on my office floor and rest. Many work situations that used to be no big deal make my heart race and make me short of breath. I never expected this would happen to me. 

It’s scary. Tons of stressful stuff has been coming at me for months and I think it just finally hit me all at once. And I’m worried this is the way I’ll feel forever. 

I’m focusing on healthy self care and taking a week off soon just to rest my body and nerves. I’m also meeting with a therapist soon.

My spouse and mother keep telling me to take it on ""one thing at a time"" but no matter what I do I spiral.  If I do one thing it means I'm not doing something else.

Advice for overworked teacher,"I'm in my 10th year of teaching middle school English. My day starts at 7:30 and ends at 4:00 but during that time, I'm teaching and attending meetings. I have to plan and grade outside of those hours, so I end up working evenings and weekends. This is typical for teachers and after 10 years, I've gotten good at keeping my head above water and limiting the number over hours I work unpaid overtime.  

I used to devote all of my time and energy to my job, and I never even tried to have any hobbies or much of a personal life. Now that I'm on meds for my anxiety and depression and I've gone to therapy, i know that i need more balance. 

I started an Etsy shop about a year ago to start selling my crochet blankets. I'm working on teaching myself how to sew and speak another language. I love to read and so I joined a book club. (All of this happened gradually over a long period of time, not all at once.) I ended up closing my Etsy shop about a year after I opened it due to lack of sales, seller fees, and just not enough time to devote to it, but still make blankets because I enjoy it so much!

Now that i have these hobbies and I looooove them, i resent the fact that i have to work so much outside of work hours and that i never have enough time to myself. 

Can you relate?? Have you found anything that helps? I have a co-teacher who always calls in sick and dumps extra work on me in order to get more balance in her life. I don't want to do that to my coworkers, but I'm not sure how to juggle both. 

I start the weekend by needing to catch up on sleep from my crazy work week and then I feel like I've wasted my down time by sleeping in! Ugh, please help.

Help for someone,"Hello.  I am here to express my concern for someone and to see if there's  anything that can be done to help this person, whom I will call ""Sam"" in this subreddit.

Sam's life revolves around work in unhealthy ways. He'll arrive at the office at  5-6 in the morning and can work 10-hour days. He'll call and email his  colleagues to discuss work in the evenings, on weekends, during holidays  when the office is closed, and during their vacation time as well. Although the office is officially closed for holidays, Sam comes in to work instead of using the time to unwind. He never slows down and  expects others to have his level of stamina by piling project after  project on them and then not allowing people the time to complete the  projects because he won't stop talking to them. Sam can also be rude. He will impose himself on others and interrupt their conversations when he  was never a part of the conversation to begin with. He also makes  inappropriate jokes about sex and has a habit of laughing at things that  should not be laughed at. He'll insult people and then laugh it off as being a joke.

Although Sam has  studied psychology and has a degree in the subject, I strongly believe  he needs psychological help himself; and given the stress of Covid-19  and workers in countries like South Korea and Japan who end up taking  their lives due to work-related stress, Sam might be trying to work  himself to death. Even though he's been advised repeatedly to leave the office early or work from home on some days, Sam does not take the  advice to heart. What are  your suggestions for helping Sam?

Venting. My story. Could use some kind words.,"I’ve been really struggling.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and major episodes of depression since I was a kid. However, for the past year I have been at my worst. 
25 F 
My dad was hit by a car on January 1st 2021. He was hurt, back broken and some ribs damaged and it was a really hard time to get through since he was just living in an RV on the street at the time. Then of course, he got covid. Luckily he didn’t have a bad illness but we were both stressed especially since he was broken and I couldn’t be there for him. Then we went over his scans from the ICU that day and behold, he had a tumor. All within a month. 
Since then it’s basically been a cancer journey. 
He had his surgery, the pathology came back that it spread to his lymph nodes which declares him with stage four prostate cancer. He is now doing adt hormone therapy which his body responds well too (his psa is now undetectable with one treatment) and then he will do radiation and he has to take an additional oral treatment and steroid daily. (I didn’t mention this but he’s fairly young 58)
He also recently finally got housing which has been huge. He has his own apartment but now his neighbors are complaining that he is loud and we are so stressed he would get kicked out of there (also I can’t even lie my dad is so quiet and they say they can hear him walking around but his floors are carpeted and he’s only 145lbs) 

Anyways back to me I guess. I’ve struggled since the beginning. When I’m anxious I can’t eat. Lost a ton of weight and now mentally I’m struggling that I’m gaining it back and feeling gross about myself. I definitely have IBS problems from the stress. I’ve recently noticed im triggered from anything on tv regarding cancer or caring for people at then end of their life. I’ll have a panic attack. I just feel so lost. I wish I had more support, don’t get me wrong my friends and bf are great but I feel like I am fighting the absolute battle anyone has to deal with.",Hayhaybooyay,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/snbkml/venting_my_story_could_use_some_kind_words/,0
Im having a mental breakdown,"Hey y'all so right now im having a mental breakdown and honestly i just need to rant.
So i go to school and im in a choir program and today i was asked what voice part do i sing for a particular song and i answered but this year i sing a different voice part. So then my teacher said ok just sing that part  but then one of my classmates said ""no you can't go we need you"" and then my teacher said ""that's right this voice part needs you""...Now i know that was supposed to be a compliment but it just made me upset.
Like why do they need me? Aren't they supposed to know their stuff? It stresses me the fuck out and then im going to be the section leader too but im so afraid that i can't do it....if i mess up it brings the whole section down. I used to be good in choir but this whole stress its causing me to make mistakes i didn't make before i stress so much that sometimes i can't even listen to music because it reminds me of choir and my mistakes....
I used to love choir really, but now i do it because i feel obligated to do it. I think to myself ""oh i can't quit because I've done it for so long and i just need to get over it"" I wish i could bring myself to talk to my close friends but it just makes me feel like a terrible burden to them and my brain will never shut up about it. I wish i could talk to my choir teacher, but im not close with them even with all the years I've been with them and they still scare me.

My sister is the cause of so much stress that I cut her off,"I cut off my sister on the first of the month. 

The beginning:

My name is Joey, and I'm a 27 year old non binary person. I grew up in a horrible situation, along with my mom and my younger sister. 

My dad was horribly, horribly abusive. He wasn't usually physically abusive to me and my sister (there are a few exceptions to this) but he would manipulate and gaslight us, and when I was 15, there was one awful night where I was forced to participate in sexual acts.

Luckily, my sister is AMAB, otherwise my dad may have forced the same sexual abuse on her. 

My mom got the same emotional abuse but also, there was a lot of physical abuse that was directed towards her.

She cared deeply for me and my sister but our dad would gaslight us both to think terrible things about our mother and she was not allowed to spend time with us except to essentially be my dad's slave. For example, she was forced to come on vacations with us but ONLY to be the driver for the car we rented. She was not permitted to participate in the fun activities or to spend time with me and my sister.

My dad would do the same with our friends, manipulating us into thinking they didn't care about us and turning us against them. 

When I was in middle school, I brought a few friends home, and my dad came up to my room about a half hour later, telling me that her mother had said something (either racist or sexual, I don't remember) and he forced the parents and my friends to leave.

The effects: 

All three of us have dealt with awful trauma after we got away from my dad. Someone told CPS and they took my sister and i into foster care while my dad ran away from the police, I was 15 at the time.

We haven't heard from him since, and my mom fought like hell to prove she was a fit parent and get us back from foster care. 

Luckily, me and my sister had a foster family that cared deeply about us and was super loving. We were only there for about 10 months and then my mom got us back.

After that, I spiraled downward to the point where I had to leave school and be on suicide watch. I would go to work with my mom every day. I was scared to be left alone.

Eventually my mom decided I needed some serious help because she was so worried about me. She found an in patient program where teens went to work on their issues. (I was 16)

I went to the program simply to appease my mom and for no other reason. I stayed there for the next 3 years and was hospitalized once for a couple days for suicidal tendencies.

However, after a while of being there, I realized it was actually working. The school program was amazing, I was really flourishing, and the work we were doing was making a difference. I was getting better. 

While I was there, I got given medication and was even diagnosed with aspergers syndrome. 

When i was a kid, my dad came to me and said, ""Your mom thinks you're r****ded.""

It turns out, my mom knew I had autism and my dad actively refused to get me tested!

Three years later, I was released home, where I was able to go back to school and complete it.

I continued to go to therapy until my therapist retired, then we found a new therapist. I've kind of been bouncing around therapists ever since, but I'm getting better everyday.

My sister, however, was not doing well. 

She actively refused to get help. Every single attempt my mom made was met with resistance. 

Living with my sister was hell on earth. She basically yelled at everyone constantly and about everything, slammed doors, and smoked weed all day. 

I guess it's better than she smoked cigarettes, though.

I live in Canada, where kids can be kicked out at age 16. The second my sister turned 16, she was out. She moved in with my cousin for a year, and it was an awesome year, all things considered. 

I was so relieved. 

Doing anything during the time my sister was living with us was very difficult.

I almost never uploaded to my YouTube channel because there was almost never a quiet moment.

I wrote. A LOT. It kept me sane due to living with my sister being such a hellish experience. 

After my sister moved out I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I was soooo happy. 

After about a year my mom allowed my sister to move back in ONLY IF she signed a contract and complied with the rules.

It didn't last long, however. My mom has never been very good at drawing lines in the sand when it comes to me and my sister, especially when it came to my sisters abuse.

She just took it and my sister just continued emotionally abusing us. My mom was having a hard time finding a balance.

At this time, I wasn't very confident and I couldn't say anything to my mom about it.

I wished so many times i had. 

Also, during this time, I was having nightmares about a man who tortured and killed me. His name was Harvey, and my sister would deliberately say his name, and/or the name of the restaurant named Harvey's just to upset me. 

Either way, we lived like this for several more years. When I turned 25, my mom announced that it was time for us all to move out. I was so relieved that I would finally be free of my sister!

My sister bounced around to friends houses and sometimes hotels while my mom invited me to move into her guest room while I looked for an apartment.

It was such a relaxing time! I had forgotten what it was like to have an uninterrupted day. I was emotionally exhausted from all those years living with my sister. 

The stress was palpable. 

My entire demeanor changed after living with my mom for a few days. I was clearly happier and less stressed. 

A few weeks went by and things were good, however, then my sister dropped a bomb. She asked me if I wanted to move in with her.

I said I had to think about it, and we hung out over the next few days. She was a completely different person. I was so happy that I had a sister again! 

My mom kept warning me against moving in with her, but her words fell on deaf ears. I had made my decision.

However, I should have listened. 

As soon as I signed the lease, my sister started acting terrible again, exactly the way she did when the three of us were living together. I think she manipulated me into getting a place with her. 

It was awful. She had a friend that came over almost every single day who seemed to keep her somewhat level. 

She treated me like garbage, though. Luckily for me, freedom was just around the corner.

I moved in with my sister in around October 2019, and in March, a certain virus hit.

Due to that, my mom let me move back in with her. I was soaring high!

It was such a relief to be living with my mom again. My sister was my torment and my mother was a safe haven.

I've been living with my mom for two years now, and we are currently looking for an apartment for me.

Why I cut my sister off:

Soon after I moved out, my sister's birthday arrived. I had just gotten a $600 cheque due to covid. I wanted to get my sister something special because of this. I bought her $100 in playstation gift cards. (She was a huge gamer at the time).

She was really happy, however, about a week or two later, she sent me and my mom a bunch of angry texts about some stupid cheese grater. Apparently, I had HER cheese grater, and she thought I knew it and bought her all those cards because I felt guilty. She also called me names and was calling me a piece of s*it and stuff like that. I blocked her, deleted her texts, and decided not to get her anything for Christmas if this was how she was going to be. (I did though).

I found out that she was gay and was dating her friend (they are both AMAB).

Some time went by. I texted her every once in a while just to let her know I loved her. 

Eventually 2021 rolled around, and my mom told me my sister was trans but that my sister wasn't allowed to know that I knew.

At the end of the summer, I was going crazy. I told my mom she needed to tell my sister that I knew. My mom texted her and let her know.

Time went by, and in September, I broke my arm. It sucked. A couple weeks after, though, she texted me and we started texting again and even talked on the phone. 

I visited her and her girlfriend (who are both AMAB mtf trans) over the Christmas holidays and spent two awesome days together!

On Jan 31 or Feb 1st I posted a story about how our relationship was much better now! My sister found out and started sending angry texts. And yeah, I messed up. I made a mistake, I admit.

I tried to apologize but my sister just said ""Not fucking cool.""

I was getting ready to just leave it alone and ignore her until she had time to calm down and talk it out like adults. Also, I didn't want to angry text. That wouldn't fix anything. It would just heat things up more, and that's no good for anyone.

Then i got another text from her.

I deleted the texts so I can't remember the exact words, but it was something about the fact that she has cut off herself from the family because my mom was manipulative and I was a psychopath (I think) who had no empathy.

Now, one of two things were happening. Either she really thought that way, in which case, why would she want to have a relationship with that kind of person? Or she was just saying mean things, which is a shitty thing to do just because I made a mistake. Which, by the way, i apologized for. If she's angry, that's fine, but that's no excuse for calling names and swearing at me.

She also said something like ""This naive child act isnt fooling anyone"" and I'm sitting there thinking ""What naive child act? The act of realizing my mistakes and apologizing for them?""

Like, I recognized my mistake and apologized. Not sure what else I can do. Like, what does she expect, me to get in a time machine and go back in time?

Anyway, i should also mention at this point that when I saw my sister during the holidays, I apologized for what I'd done in the past. My sister didn't.

I didn't really care at the time. I just let me go because I thought our relationship was headed in a good direction and I didn't want anything to mess it up.

However, my sister keeps using excuses that she has trauma and anxiety or whatever every single time she messes up. She won't admit what she's done in the past and/or apologize for it.

She seems to think that she doesn't make mistakes, and she can use her anxiety/trauma/ptsd as an excuse so she doesn't have to take responsibility for her actions. 

After that text message I blocked her and deleted all the texts. I wondered how long I would have to leave her blocked for this time. But i slept on it and decided that this was it. It was over. She was no good for me and she was one of the toxic people that I needed to cut out of my life. 

I'd cut several people out my life at this point, including both of my ex boyfriends and a friend. 

I should add that my dad used to fly off the handle whenever we made one little mistake. Even when it was something that we fixed in some way (I can't think of how better to say it).

For example, I forgot to charge my phone the day before my dad wanted me to walk home by myself and he was going to call me and give me directions. I forgot to charge my phone, so I called my dad crying on the phone from the school phone. I got voicemail and he didn't pick up. 

I walked home all by myself and I was so proud! Unfortunately, my dad wasn't. He yelled at me. He made me write lines and grounded me, even though I had called him to let him know what had happened and walked home all by myself.

I wasn't proud of myself anymore.

Anyway my sister keeps doing the exact same thing.

I'm done with her forever. If she ever wants to apologize I will forgive her but I will never let her back in again.

I'm not posting this on a throwaway because:

1. I don't want it to be confidential and I want you all to know who it's coming from.

2. I want to know if my sister is keeping up with my reddit posts.

3. I want my sister to see this and know who it's coming from.

4. I'm hoping my sister will see this and get her s*it together. (Although I seriously doubt it).",_GenderNotFound,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/sn4lgx/my_sister_is_the_cause_of_so_much_stress_that_i/,0

Just been diagnosed with a disease and stress causes flares,"I have just been diagnosed with a disease and stress is a major contributing factor towards flares and sickness.  

I have a range of issues in my life.  I have a sibling with undiagnosed bpd who has harassed me for years and interrogated me for every breath I took because she's not in control of her own emotions and feelings. She tried to sabotage every piece of my life. We haven't seen each other in years and she's still doing it. She won't stop til I have nothing left - my job, home, partner, family - she wants to destroy everything because she's not happy. The cops won't help me because she's not threatening violence and I don't have the means to take a civil injunction to court to stop her. 

Then my next biggest issue is my job. It can get incredibly intense.  There was a period last summer where I was required to move into work and work split shifts and work 9 days straight.  When that stint came, the idea of split shifts was a lie to ge time to work.  My boss tried to sabotage any breaks that were planned in the middle of the day for me. Basically I was living in work and I was required to get up when the nutjobs woke at cock-a-doodle time 3 - 5 am in the morning and then work all day til it was time to go to bed at night time.  

I also worked this stint during a heatwave.  I don't tolerate the heat and sun very well and I suffered. 

By the time I got a day off work, I became ssick. I was referred to the hospital and a health condition has been found that will be life changing for me going forward.

Had a meltdown today,"Today I was criticised for being too slow at work. It’s the first time in 15 years of my job that this has happened. Usually I’m early hitting my targets. And it hit me hard. I literally felt trapped and exploded with rage after the meeting. 

Why, I hear you ask, did this happen, and why did I explode? 

In December, as the icing on a cake of shit, my wife had a car accident. She had a seizure  whilst she and out youngest (21 months) drove home from her work/his nursery. They were both ok, but the car was written off and she was instructed that she couldn’t drive for 6-12 months pending a neurological investigation. (She’s epileptic and this was one of two seizures she’s had… in twenty years)

So, I was tasked with taking and picking up our eldest to school, and our youngest to nursery. A round trip of about 1hr 45 mins (together). On top of working a stressful job in computer graphics in a senior role. 

With inflation hitting living expenses, rising costs of fuel etc, my anxiety over those is at a high worrying we’ll never be able to move house as our current house is now too small for a family of 4. 

This is, of course, on top of covid. In December 2019, we lost a close friend to cancer, then 2020 covid hit. My wife lost her mum, aunt, and uncle in the space of two weeks at the end of March/early April, then we lost a family friend. The following week, we had our second child… the same week, I lost my permanent job of 12 years. We also lost another close friend and then my wife’s cousin passed away. 

I scrambled to make ends meet in a part time teaching role, but had to also look after our two boys as school and nursery were closed down. 

It has honestly been the worst 2 years I’ve ever experienced. And today, stressed with the constant task of getting my kids to school/nursery, I hit rock bottom. 

I won’t say I contemplated suicide because I couldn’t do that, but I was certainly left with the sense that there is basically no way out. I’m trapped. 

I don’t know what the fuck to do to be faster at my job when I’m already doing a 14 hour day between sorting out the kids with my wife, and working.

When she is mad at me she stays silent which to me I feel its emotional abuse. I feel like I can’t get out of this marriage. I feel stuck and I feel like I am controlled by.

Burnout,"I've been having really bad burnout for more than a year. 
Probably caused by lockdowns and school. Just finished and am about to go to university. I want to get this problem figured out ASAP but most psychologists are booked out.

My problem is that my memory has gotten significantly worse. I used to remember everything that happened in a day, people I met conversations I had etc, and could recall anything from 2 weeks before. Now I don't even remember what happened in my day and barely how I got where I am. 

I just don't feel like myself. As if my mind is floating off somewhere.

Haven't found anyone experiencing the same issues.

If anyone has had anything similar I would really appreciate it if you could give some insight (hopefully it's not a brain tumour or something).",CinnamonPrawn,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/sfyarh/burnout/,0

First time in my life I’m feeling stressed and it sucks.,"25M married with 4 kids. I make okay money $69,000 a year salary. No longer have a savings. Used my Emergency savings of $25k last few weeks. I put $14,000 down on a house I just bought. Still waiting on closing. 

But then my car broke down so I dropped $11k on a used car. So now I have no savings. But I’m not worried about it I have $1,000 disposable a month. So no big deal just dump that into emergency fund instead of retirement. 

Well my company just went under and so I am I employed with no savings. Not a problem I’ll get a new job. Well I managed to get a new job in about 2 days. Went from $69k salary to $155k a year great no worries. 

But I don’t start for 3 more weeks. Okay s little worried but I got the a little saved so I can manage. Then I find out I don’t get paid for 4 weeks first check will only have 2 days on it and it’s going to be 6 weeks before first full paycheck. 

I don’t have 3 months worth of expenses o got 2 max. But on top of that my new job is a 1 1/2 hour drive one way so I’ll be burning gas I can’t afford till I get paid. So new travel for job takes me down to 1 month of savings if I set aside money to get back and forth to work. 

So I’m a little stressed out and looking into options. It just seemed like everything was going right till it just went completely wrong. Granted I more then doubled my pay but being able to make it to that first paycheck is going to be a tough one.",justanotherusedacc,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/sellom/first_time_in_my_life_im_feeling_stressed_and_it/,0

Ugh,"

I have struggled a lot with my confidence for the first past few years, I’m only 17 and sometimes it just get to me I started and new job in the summer  holidays last year and at first it was nice to have something to do instead of sitting in my bed feeling bad for myself, I made some friends at work and it was going good till about 1 month ago where I fell back into that depression again and I don’t feel like I want to leave my bed I also have college in the week the only days I do get off I’m spent doing college work or nothing enjoyable, my new college has been tiring cause I have friends but not close I never really have had a friend I can talk to about my problem’s like I’m in a group of three people and these two girls are closer even though we have all know each other for the same amount of time I guess it just makes me feel sad when there close hugging etc and I feel left out like I always have, it’s like they do include me in things but it just doesn’t feel right I will sometimes just be with one of them on their own and we just sit in this like awkward silence and barely even talk unless it’s about class work or classes that we have, it was the same in secondary school (high school) I had a group of friends and there was seven of us and I never really felt close with them either not enough to share stuff with them then eventually when our group got smaller and some of us didn’t speak but I did with one of the girls and we were close for a while until college (before I moved College to the one I am in now), when we got split up into different classes even though we signed up for the same course she became close with this girl and when we would sit together at lunch she would bring her too and I just never feel good about myself cause people in think are close to me leave me all the time or get new best mates and we were close like we did everything together we even walked to college the day it started together, then we fell out and things haven’t been the same since especially me moving college which I needed to do for my health now I’m seeing her posting pictures with this girl all the time and it’s the same with the two girls in my new college they will take pictures together in class while I’m sitting on there table and will leave me to myself.

Also going back to my job a month ago I was close with this girl cause I’d get the bus too my new college with her, and of course there happened to be a new employee that we have shifts with on the weekend and they get close since there both eighteen they got out clubbing together and drink together I feel like when I’m eighteen she will probably not invite me out for drinks, basically the whole vibe at work has changed cause the people that are similar age range as me from about 17/20 years old I worked with before the new girl came along we got along we would talk after serving customers but now they just talk to her, also my break time has changed and they gave her my break time ,although it not a big deal I just feel so put out like I’m never going to have a good close friend.
Also don’t even get me started on the stress the college is putting on me to pass English otherwise next year I can’t do the course that I enjoy.

I’m also feeling jealous cause of my younger sister who is starting college this year, she is so smart and I’m just dumb like all the marks she is getting in her tests I didn’t get half of when I was in school I barely passed any classes and got 2’s and she is here getting 7’s, also new insecurity unlocked she has a boyfriend and I have never had one that Ioved me as much as hers does.

I know that this rant is stupid but it’s been keeping me up at night every night thinking about these things I just don’t get why no one likes me long enough and why I keep losing all these people.",Odd_Finance5326,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/sedqeq/ugh/,0
I am so lost and confused,"
I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, anxiety, social anxiety, ocd but my diagnosis has changed a few times. The problem is I am EXTREMELY sensitive to any stress to the point where it is actually unbelievable. An example is that a 15 minute light jog could burn me out for days and I don’t know what to do about it because the steps that people usually take to get well and increase their mental well being can end up burning me out so I am so lost and confused about what to do and no one around me seems to fully understand, even my psychiatrist and nurses etc. I’ve been focusing alot on my mental health recently and I cut out alcohol for the last month and started exercising every second day very lightly and only for 12-15 minutes and things were starting to pick up and my mood was improving and then last week I had to get the booster vaccine and I got side effects from it and felt like crap and run down and the stress from that has burnt me out completely and now I’m back to square one and feeling run down and depressed again. It’s like I can’t win, it feels like I’m just not meant to be in this earth because I am so extremely sensitive to everything. How the heck am I meant to live like this?? I’m meant to be going to Disneyland with my family for a few days but I probably won’t be able to go because the flights are really early and the lack of sleep that day will completely burn me out once again and destroy my mood.

When you don't have time for a burnout,"So I'm getting very burned out on a work project right now. Thing is, if I bail out of this project now, only 2 weeks before the deadline, it will have negative consequences for everyone around me.

If anyone got any tips for pushing through when it feels impossible, please share. I've felt like I've been about to cry the whole day... The main issue here is my self esteem, everyone's telling me I'm doing a great job and that I'm not behind schedule, but I just feel like all my work is trash and that I am so far behind that I won't make the deadline either way.

Returning to work - COVID-19,"So I've been working from home 5 days a week for the past 3 years since the COVID outbreak happened. Over the last few years I've became increasing comfortable working here knowing that I'm able to keep myself and my family safe without any issues. 

My boss recently contacted me about returning to the office and I've had my worries. I work with people who don't take the virus serious, many have had the vaccine but refuse to wear masks and one refuses to wear a mask or get the vaccine at all. Safe to say I'm a little anxious about returning as one person in the office has had COVID 2 times and at least 4 other people have also had it due to being careless. It's even gotten to the point where employees from other companies that we share the building with have complained to the landlord about my co-workers refusal to wear a mask in common areas that we share such as hallways and toilets. 

I know it's only going to be a matter of time before I have to return for at least 2-3 days a week while working from home and while they have relaxed things such as dress codes and have also done things such as space out works and gave us all wireless keyboards and mouse's to reduce the risk I still feel worried about returning. 

Has anyone else been in my situation were co-workers just aren't taking things seriously? I wouldn't feel too worried getting COVID myself because I've had 3 vaccines and I feel like I could endure the virus if I got it but I try and think about other people including my grandparents who I also care for full time. 

Any advice on the matter would be nice if possible.

To cut to the chase, I am living in a toxic family environment where my mother and father can’t get along with one another and are constantly arguing. To make matters worse, both parents enlist the help of us to prove their point, creating further family tension. I am currently 16 years old and am in the final weeks before I enter the big year 11 (I live in Australia). All of this combined is giving me a bunch of unwanted stress.

To make matters worse, I’ve had a few migraines this month and I have an inkling that this is why.

I post here to ask for some advice regarding my current situation. Should I get help? Are there any strategies you guys suggest to help me cope with the oncoming wave of stress? I am not depressed. I live a rather happy life outside of the house. At school I work hard to achieve the results I want and I generally live a pretty normal life day to day.

Are the precise symptoms of stress any different, for example the types of headaches (areas, how it feels, etc.) compared to casual stress that shows no difference of symptoms between the two illnesses?

Motivation tips?,"To quickly summarise I have no motivation whatsoever which is terrible because I have my A levels in a few months but I can’t focus or bring myself to study. I have a test tomorrow which I haven’t started revising for and I can feel the anxiety building up in me yet I’m still here on my phone -my biggest distraction. I honestly hate being on my phone,hate social media but I seem to be on it 24/7. I do want to do well and go to university. I am smart and I know I have the potential to do very well which is the worst part as I know I’m wasting it. I always leave things to the last minute and procrastination is what I do best. I also hate doing badly in tests and getting things wrong so not sure why I can’t bring myself study.

Tips on coping with stress-induced irritability and avoiding snapping at people?,"Hey Redddit,

So, considering I'm posting in this Reddit, I'm sure it's no surprise that I'm very stressed at the moment. I know the exact causes of the stress and unfortunately it can't be avoided (it's related to a big project I'm working on and a looming deadline, plus some other personal things), I'm trying to get the stressor out of the way as quick as possible but it also involves all-nighters or minimal sleep, etc. So not great for my physical or mental health in any way, but unavoidable in my current situation.

I can sort of cope with everything else, I'm an expert at power naps at this point, etc, etc, but the one thing I'm really struggling with is that... stress makes me a real asshole to be around. I've snapped at people a lot and am just a lot more irritable, and I take things too personally that I know aren't meant that way but I'm not functioning in a capacity where I can process them at any other level but face value until *after* I've reacted like a complete jerk. 

Sometimes it's easier for people to tell I'm just stressed, e.g. on occasion I'll snap over something really small and be on the verge of tears so it's clear that I'm kind of a mess mentally and my friends know not to take it to heart in that moment. But sometimes I just come off as flat out angry or on the offense. The last thing I need right now is to be alienating people so this has to stop! 

Yes, this level of stress is thankfully not going to last forever so thankfully it's temporary, and yes I apologise to people after, but ideally I'd just like to... not be an asshole in the first place. 

How do people cope with this sort of thing? Have you found anything that works? I'm generally pretty chill (well, outwardly, I have anxiety but I'm pretty good at managing how much of it shows up), and if I do get upset I get sad rather than angry. So I have no idea how to manage an outburst like that in the first place, and it takes me aback just as much as it does the people around me.

I am burned out,"I’ve known it for years that I’m not going to right direction. But when it finally happens it’s overwhelmingly awful. Burning out.

For me years of work stress finally manifested as burnout through multiple physical symptoms. 

In one month I went from stressed but working into being on sick leave and suffering from Tinnitus, Heartburn, Heart Palpitations and insomnia. Leading back to increased anxiety and depression. 

I went from not having medication into anti depressants, stomach meds, sleeping pills..

I’m also doing therapy which I tried to to do with meditation to avoid medication but seems like I need all help now.

I hope this encourages people to listen your stress and seek help before it gets worse.

Is this a mental or medical problem?,"Hi guys. Need some advice.

For over give years now I've been able to sort of click/crack my jaw out of place. Don't remember how it started, I would have been quite young. All I know is its sort of... An addiction? I need to do it every few seconds to feel normal. If I don't do it, I can't focus on anything else.

Thing is, I never took into consideration that it may be really damaging to my jaw. I've tried to stop but it's all I can think about.

However, I've also noticed that I don't do it as often if I'm at home, doing something like playing a game or talking to friends/family. However, if I'm at school I can't stop it, and it's constant. It gives me a headache when I do it all day.

I can now click the jaw on both sides as of about 3 months ago. I feel like this really is not OK and I don't know if it's a stress thing. I have no idea where to go or what to do about this issue. I'm sorry for even asking about something so stupid, I just worry because I'm so young and my jaw is this bad already.

Do you think this is stress? Should I see a doctor? How would I explain it?

Stress due to living situation and marriage.,"Hi everyone,

So, I’m going to try to explain this as briefly as possible as to not bore the crap out of you all. 

My husband and I have been together for 10 years (married for just over 7). I moved to Germany to be with him after we met in the US (where I’m originally from). I have never been completely happy here in Germany, I miss my friends and family and I don’t have the career I wanted to have (mostly due to opportunities here compared to in the states). Before we married the plan was to eventually move to the states. I don’t sense any real desire from him to do so. I feel like I’ve wasted time on this marriage and am realizing that we just want different things out of life. The biggest problem I’m having at the moment is that we have pets and I want to take them back to the states with me but it is going to be difficult to find a rental with several pets. 

I feel guilty up and leaving my marriage to pursue what I need for me. I’ve given up a lot for this relationship and he hasn’t had to compromised away his goals and family to be with me the way that I have. 

My question is - should I feel guilty for wanting more out of my life if that entails leaving my marriage? I sometimes feel like I’m either choosing guilt or resentment.",bluelovely87,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/s2fxt9/stress_due_to_living_situation_and_marriage/,0

Existence is nye,"Not sure why but as of late I’m generally getting fucked by fate more and more, last year early December I was shopping for a new car, it had been ages since I was mobile and my girlfriend lives one state away from me so it’s hard for us to have time to relax together, mid December I bought a car on financing, and early January it started to have issues, the thing is, I’ve picked up a second job recently, and my current job just doesn’t seem to pay enough or give enough hours to even be considered full time, I work at 2 small businesses downtown about a mile away from my moms house, which sucks to be in considering I’m about to turn 21 and barely have enough money for my car payment, I haven’t gotten paid for my second job yet as I started about a week ago, and my checks from my current job are around 300$ which once my car payment hits (255$) it’s turned into dust, I’ve been waking up later than usual and I’m not proud of that, I like to be to work 10 minutes before scheduled and recently have been 1-2 whole hours late, my car just lost all power steering so I’m currently walking to work now, I’m in debt to my credit card company and my mom takes 100$ every month for her type of “rent” to buy groceries, but I can’t even use my credit card because of how bad my debt in the account is, just this current couple of weeks I’ve never thought about suicide more, and that’s absolutely insane considering I’ve attempted before, my girlfriend and I have been having minor issues in our relationship, like I can’t make the effort as I used to for her anymore, and my mother is barraging me with owed money to her, but I don’t want to tell her I’m in debt 3,000$ when she says I owe her 300$ or so, I don’t have the time, money, or resources to get my car fixed, I get home so late in the night that working on the car seems impossible, I’m just so lost as to what I have left to do to make everything better, last summer I had a shitty little truck, 2 jobs, and enough money to do what I needed if needed, but now I can barely stack up any savings, all of my money goes to getting places, all of my time goes to being at work, and every night as I try to sleep my thoughts keep me up, in a cycle of anger, then sadness, then back to anger as to “why can’t I just sleep?” And then sadness onto that same subject, “well if I could just fucking go to bed I wouldn’t be late to work, I’d make more money, have more time” but that cycle repeats and I end up getting to bed so late that I unintentionally sleep in and become late for work, I don’t know what to do anymore, if school had taught me about adulting maybe I’d be better off, but a highschool dropout can’t blame schooling for his own mistakes, I have nowhere to go but the same grey cubicle I’ve grown up in and grown to hate, what did I do to god to make it hate my existence, why would I be put on this planet to want to leave it so badly?",Anythingtodie,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/s1q3o8/existence_is_nye/,0

"Work stress caused sickness, How do I deal with another intense work week being planned","I sometimes experience stress from work. I am a nanny for a family. Sometimes the hours can be long, the load can be intense, often there are issues with one of the younger children who has special needs/non verbal autism.  The child likes to attack often and lashes out.  Sometimes the parents like to get away and I am at their home picking everything up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I usually when stressed I deal with it in my own free time through hobbies that relax me.

&amp;#x200B;

Last summer I had a week from hell at work.  I was living in for a week because the parents were gone. The plan was split shifts for the week when others coming in to help for the week.  It never worked out like that.  The child wasn't able to sleep properly and I was up at 3-4 am every morning with her.  When she went to school, I was supposed to have a break but then the parents scheduled house improvements for the same week which they forgot about and a team of workers came in top of me who wanted me to clear out rooms.  So the breaks that I was scheduled to have were pretty much denied. This week coincided with an intense heatwave.  So my work days were a 3-4 am start until about 11 or 12 at night finish time with only short breaks throughout.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I got off work, I became ill.   My GP referred me to the hospital for tests but I am on a waiting list to be seen.  My GP gave me a vague diagnosis but we don't know it yet until I am tested.

&amp;#x200B;

Stress is a common trigger for the condition.  Over the past 3 months or so, I was managing well.   February is scheduled to be another crazy month for work. The parents are going away for spring break and wants me at home in their home.  For 10 days.  I know it's only a matter of time before they dump the load on me no matter what.  I'm dreading the week coming up because the parents are so sneaky.  I am apprehensive too about it all now too because of the covid situation. We are all vaccinated but I am still worried.  What if the parents contract the virus when they are away and what if they become ill and what if they need to isolate and what if they can't come home as planned?

&amp;#x200B;

What if I get sick while they are away?

What if the special needs child get sick?

What if the child picks up covid in school and brings it home to me? What if I get ill.   I know it's said to be mild but mild just means you don't need hospital. It might still mean a sickness at home for one or two weeks. Am I expected just to keep on working during sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also being investigated for another condition from last summer.  What if the stress is high and sleep is low? What if stress causes another flare and I get sick again? What if covid and a flare happens together?   This also leaving out physical assaults from the child too. She's non verbal but she's going to know her parents are gone and shes going to last out on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get paid enough for this. It will be March by the time a little bit of a break might come my way.",summerrosegarden,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/s1b82v/work_stress_caused_sickness_how_do_i_deal_with/,0
Can stress cause heart rate to increase even when not stressed?,"A few weeks ago I got dizzy and collapsed. Other symptoms included, mental confusion, weakness, fatigue, shallow breathing and stomach discomfort. 

I got a range of tests done including: Blood tests, x rays, ecg, and ultrasound. Everything came back normal. I’ve since got a bit better. 

But two things happen when I stand up, my heart rate increases and fluctuates a lot between 103bpm and 125bpm. As well as blood pressure lowering from 120 at lying down to about 105. 

I’ve spoken to a doctor about this and they said that’s not high. But I’ve always been at around 90-95bpm when standing up and walking around the house.

home is not a calming place anymore,"Hi all. Over the past couple of years, especially since I've been stuck at home a lot more than I ever have been, our home isn't the safe and comforting space it used to be. I have emetophobia and one of our dogs started getting sick a LOT in 2020. We think we've got that under control, but he still gets sick every now and then. In December, my husband got a stomach bug and was sick for a few days. I just feel like our home is dirty (it isn't, we have a weekly routine) and sometimes I don't want to come home and (specifically) be around our dogs. Sometimes I sleep in our guest room just so I can be 100% alone and away from everyone and that helps. For the most part, I'm fine now. I went to therapy for about 6 months to help overcome my phobia. I still struggle with it, but it's not near as bad as it used to be.

So, to get to the end, does anyone have tips on how to make our home feel like home again? We're renting and I have the desire to just move, but that's definitely out of the question right now.

Feelings Thinking Catalyzation,"In pain, migraine, cold, heat, stress or some other condition, whatever is felt is sometimes the only thing on the mind.

In various moments, there are no thoughts on anything at all, just that feeling. When other thoughts come on anything else, they do so while feeling remains at that destination, so no matter what the thoughts are, they meet a foul mood for feelings being there.

This is similar, but different from when feelings go down because of a news or disappointment, which may bring fast heart rate or breathing, and those too become active thoughts, which may feel audible — in moments.

Theoretically, there is never an absence of thoughts on the mind in any state or situation. Thoughts can be active or passive. Passive thoughts or environmental awareness are more numerous. They often interchange with active thoughts. For anything to give a feeling it has to become an active thought. There are often fleeting active thoughts, but the feelings they bring may last longer even when the thoughts no longer become active. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rqtxjh/for\_mental\_health\_cognitive\_triangle\_assumptions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/rqtxjh/for_mental_health_cognitive_triangle_assumptions/)

Thoughts are motion. Feelings are destinations. Feelings have a vertical where they are determined: for regular, worse, sleep and best. There is a line of process facing the verticals where active thoughts go. Active thoughts can be engaging, seen by their lengthiness towards the verticals.

There is a thought box and a memory box. The thought box has an entry port that converts everything internal and external to thought. It is this thought version of everything the memory takes, stores, processes and gives. Pain becomes a thought, same for cold, heat, stress and so on. It is the converted thought from these that go to the destination of feelings, theoretically.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/rp6iks/when\_thoughts\_effectuate\_migraines/](https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/rp6iks/when_thoughts_effectuate_migraines/)

Feelings can be bearable or unbearable depending on if there is a worse or better feeling on the mind at that time. In a very happy state, certain not nice stuff may not be felt. In a very sad state, nominally happy stuff may not be felt.

There is a memory role for what is felt. Though ghrelin is secreted for appetite, and leptin for satiation, some people will not feel like they have eaten if there isn’t a particular type of thing ingested. This says that what the memory stored, or grouped to mean satiation has to include that meal or thing, else they will continue to feel appetitive even if no ghrelin secretion, or leptin gets secreted.

There is a feeling aspect of every thought, even if the feeling are neutral. There are also some situations where the only thing that can work against bad feelings is something that can bring the best feel vertical. Feelings for someone or anything is destination for the thoughts of that person or thing. Feelings are mutable, since thoughts version of anything continue to come — which may change feelings. Emotions are a type of feeling.

finding beauty in simplicity,"These past few years I feel like I have matured so much mentally (as I'm sure a lot of us have) and I genuinely find beauty in just everyday tasks.

Exams increasing physical symptoms,"Heyo friendos,

Exams are coming up for me and I've noticed that my stress levels are higher than I've ever experienced them as I'm showing symptoms I've never had before.

Extreme stomach aches, nausea to the point of dry heaving, restless sleep or no sleep, to name a few.

The course I'm studying is my absolute passion and due to circumstances it is my very last shot at it this exam season. The pressure has been immense. I've also stopped smoking weed for about half a year now, which was a decision I made because I wanted to give my studies my all. It started out well, no noticeable semi-long-term effects, but now I'm starting to wonder if quitting weed cold-turkey after smoking every day for a few years is starting to take its toll.

Does anyone have experience with this? Am I just feeling too much pressure due to the circumstances or could it be the weed thing too, or perhaps both? How do y'all cope with physical symptoms?",24204me,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/rwymfy/exams_increasing_physical_symptoms/,0

I hit a wall and now I feel like I’m made of glass. Two weeks of holiday/PTO haven’t helped me. What do I do?,"I’ve been in therapy for C-PTSD for years and that was going really well when the pandemic hit. I’m incredibly privileged when it comes to Covid - nobody in my family has gotten sick, I haven’t lost anyone, my spouse and I were already working from home, and in a weird way the pandemic actually brought my family closer together. 

But a couple months ago I hit what I’d call the biggest wall I’ve ever faced. I used to be so resilient, so strong. I had perspective and I could handle small things. But lately, I’ve felt so fragile. Like you could knock me over with a feather. I had a little over a week off for the holiday and I took an additional week afterwards, which I’m in the middle of now. I go back to work on Monday and I’m absolutely terrified of crying at work. But I’ve cried every day over something. Yesterday it was an episode of Queer Eye - not a big shock, that show makes people cry, but I like full on wept. This morning my son accidentally broke a new novelty glass we’d bought for Christmas - it was like $7 but I had to go sit in my office and sob over it so the kids wouldn’t see me cry over something so silly. 

Maybe the worst is that all of my friends are going through way worse right now - medical problems, relationship issues, having to stay with family after getting kicked out of their homes. I feel so stupid for having this problem, I can’t talk to them about it because what they’re all dealing with is a million times worse. So, I’m taking to an anonymous discussion board in the hopes that someone out there can help. I want my resilience back. I don’t want to cry every day. I don’t want to feel like I’d shatter into a million pieces if anything went wrong.",samata_the_heard,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/rwnjxu/i_hit_a_wall_and_now_i_feel_like_im_made_of_glass/,1

i'm gonna talk about how i spent 2021.and its rly bad.,"tbh.i rly didnt care about this new year cuz my time since 2019 was just meh.although i am happy to do hobby (but unforunatly,recently i felt unmotivated and not passionate like i used to be cuz many problems happened that involved ""SCHOOL"",my hobby,my future career and my family.and im still disappointed how my family backstabed.instead of helping me and support me with the decision of leaving school (it was destroying my mental health) they just told me horrible stuff and said that ""i will be worthless,my hobby wont do anything for me"" cuz i still didnt plan for my future career.but the most shocking thing that i had in 2021 and this is actualy not a joke.my therapist who was supposted to help me.after like 5 sessions.she didnt see any improvment.she kicked me out cuz ""i didnt improve at all"" and at that moment i was going to tell her something important.she didnt even let me say anything.i was crying there cuz i was thinking that my mental health will not get better and i will live my life just depressed and unmotivated to do anything.and since then,i rly dont trust therapists,after all they are just hungry for money.what makes this even worse is the fact that my family actually thought it was my fault for not improving.but my question is if you are depressed for 5 years,school is a compelete joke to you,your family is either delusional or fake and they use your hobby as a tool to say horrible stuff.how are you gonna handle all of this.2021 rly sucked for my hobby due to all of this stress.the best thing to be honest that i did in that year was actualy droping out of school cuz it was a huge problem.the only good thing that i had there was friends and teachers.funny enough,they do support me more than my own family,my blood.and what made it worse is the fact that they used my hobby as a tool to just ""motivate me"" for doing something.where in reality they ruined it for me.so not only my hobby is in the worst situation.but also my therapists think ""im lazy"" cuz im not doing anything.but also it is the biggest lie i have heard in 2021.cuz te thing is that im trying to improve my mental health.i just dont know where to start.but out of nowhere,they assumed that i was lazy.now how am i lazy when im working my ass off to try solving the issues of my mental health.while they literally siting on their chairs,helping me and then get bored of me cuz i didnt get ""improved"" and tell me to leave.and to this day im still mad at this cuz now i realized therapists is one of the biggest scandals ever.now i understand that my therapist wanted me to get better.but becouse you got bored cuz i didnt get ""improved""dosent mean you should kick me out of the office and not letting me finish my line.thats just rude.that is called sabotaging not helping.i just hope that this year will fix everything that 2021 ruined and i hope all of the people that are suffering like me or worse will have a great and an amazing year and the lesson that i learned from 2021 is ""dont you ever.let people sobotaging you and your dreams"".peace :)",nooobsdza,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/rw05dz/im_gonna_talk_about_how_i_spent_2021and_its_rly/,0

School stress," 

School these days are really overwhelming for me, it's getting so overwhelming that I can't live in serene anymore. I keep on worrying about my grades because they are really so terrible, I got many 80 something and can't keep all my grades on 97 or 95. It just feels like a burden! And I'm just in grade 8!

Every time there is a test I study very hard, then after it, I keep on worrying about the results. And when the results come, it doesn't even live up to my expectations. One time I even failed a math test because I was too nervous.

Except for tests, I still need to worry about competitions and honor classes. But it's getting so overwhelming that I start to procrastinate. There is so much work that I don't even have any time to practice the piano and read books. There is so much homework that I have to sleep at 12:00 am all the time. Every time I feel like a burden I just escape into my daydreams, but when I come back to reality, I have to face the stress again! I just feel like I'm so stupid. My close friends all got full marks or good grades on projects and tests easily, so I feel like the dumbest when you compare me to them. They are even good at every single subject at school. Every time I see their grade and compare it to me it has like a 10000000000% percentage difference.

Mistakes Spoken,"I didn't speak up much when I was in school (middle and high). I don't know if it was fear of saying something stupid or just not really having anything to say. The development of social capabilities hindered from a choice made at a young age. 

Somedays I understand that choice in a big way. Why put words out there that really don't need to be spoken, they aren't important/ they don't matter. If spoken they can be twisted and manipulated even when they were originally spoken without any ill intent. Just stop talking.  Just stop engaging. If you stop they won't hurt you and you won't hurt others. 

I remember I used to get a sore throat from talking 'too much' . Then it became normal to engage with the world and converse with others.

Today is one of those days I find myself wishing back my silent younger self. I am mad at myself for making the wrong choice for even saying anything.

Is it self-harm to disconnect now? 

I overthink and over analyze and come to the conclusion I fucked up, and I never can let that go. It doesn't have to be a big fuck up, it can be small one. (Still thinking of the one time I picked the wrong box on Deal or No Deal during a classroom game 15 years ago).

Am I stressed?,"I experience a lot of physical symptoms that can all be caused by stress. I have tried to minimize all other causes and stress seems to be the common one. These include; IBS, exzema, loss of period (6 months now), neck and shoulder pain,  now my jaw hurts all the time (like I'm clenching at night).  I can't find other reasons for these symptoms. I have had blood tests done, I try to ""relax"", exercise once in a while. I eat mostly healthy foods and got rid of big trigger foods. Got a nightguard.  I even just started talking to a therapist. 

The reason I'm confused is because I have had really tough and unbearable moments of stress in my life - but not recently. In fact I'd say I'm the most comfortable and happy that I've been in a very very long time. Whats been stressing me out the most is all of these symptoms and trying to figure out what's wrong with me. When I was ACTUALLY going through stressful times,  I barely felt any physical side effects.  Or maybe I just didn't notice them.  But I'm doing so much better now in my life and I get really frustrated and quite frankly pissed off that my body is causing me more anxiety and stress than anything else in my life is. 

Doctors can't find what's wrong with me,  and they all say stress can be the most obvious reason.  But what do they want me to do,  yoga all day? I have also tried weed but I only get sleepy and I have a lot of work to get done (I enjoy my work). My husband is a great wall to lean on and always helps me feel like there is no problem we can't fix.  So why am I always feeling so uptight and worried? I feel like everything is going so well and one day it will all implode. 

If it IS stress.  How do you release tension when you don't know where it's coming from?",nalorie13,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/rnn99j/am_i_stressed/,0

How to Get Through Tough Days in One Piece," My course, “How to Get Through Tough Days in One Piece” shows you how to do that by using life mantras; tools you can use to stay calm and carry on life hurdles. I am a Certified Life Coach, and my specialty is stress management for parents who are getting divorced. Marriage is the most passionate bond that we can have as human beings; when those bonds break, it will cause an emotional blender that results in tons of very intense emotions and a lot of stress, but we still have to function. We still have to get through the days, we still have to go to work, we have the kids to take care of, our parents to take care of, and we still have our friends that we want to nurture. On top of all of that, we've got all this added stuff like getting paperwork done, getting documents together, negotiating with the ex, and meeting with all these professionals, the lawyers, and the accountants.

"This is one of the adverse causes of stress, leading to premature aging."," 

Under the overwhelming responsibilities and being in the rush in the fast-growing modern world, stress is sometimes unavoidable. Hence, the cases of inflammation increase in clinical papers. When the stress becomes chronic and uncontrollable it can be a detriment for the body. These long-term stresses are linked to chronic inflammations.

When the body is under the condition of stress the organism goes through fight-and-flight responses. This is the body’s reaction to some harmful attacks for its survival. During this process cortisol- a stress hormone is released. Cortisol suppresses digestion and accurate immune response to stress. It sends signals to the brain that affects [**mood, motivation, and fear**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037#:~:text=Adrenaline%20increases%20your%20heart%20rate,of%20substances%20that%20repair%20tissues.).

Cortisol causes excess production of glucose (blood sugar), prevents the production of insulin, and narrows the arteries. This is the reason why the blood starts pumping harder under the stress. Adrenalin is another hormone that causes increased heart and respiratory rate also causes blood pressure.

When the body is under constant stress flight-or-fight responses are always present. Consequently, when the stress responses are always on and the hormones constantly restrict the body’s natural processes many diseases such as anxiety, depression, metabolic disorders, and obesity can come forth. Stresses can also be aggravators for multiple sclerosis. There are [**studies**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115807/), linking the stressful lifestyle and the exacerbation of the diseases.

Another major cause of inflammation can be oxidative stress. This is the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also known as free radicals in the body’s cells and tissues. And the insufficiency of antioxidants (fighters against free radicals) can be extremely harmful to cellular molecules, cause DNA damage, proteins.

The balanced amount of ROS is considered to be even profitable for the body being involved in the cell homeostasis and functions such as gene expression and activation of [**receptors.**](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC5055983&amp;blobtype=pdf)

Several factors and lifestyles can bring to oxidative stress. Unrestrained and extreme amounts of exercise, smoking and drug misuse, fatty, processed, and refined food, and even untreated injuries or traumas are major causes of oxidative stress.

The production of an excessive amount of ROS in the body can lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines (regulators of inflammatory reactions). There is a line of evidence from [**studies**](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2013/963520/), that oxidative stress plays a pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Generated ROS in brain tissues can lead to neuroinflammation and cell death later causing neurodegenerative diseases and memory loss.  


Chronic inflammation is a serious case and has a significant link to aging and longevity. Healthy life management and a conscious lifestyle can increasingly decrease the possibility of any type of inflammations and enhance longevity.",Hello100_real,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/rm4g6v/this_is_one_of_the_adverse_causes_of_stress/,0

Does anybody else stress about the smallest things as if the world is going to end?,"I always take the tiny things and overthink them. I can't help but think the worst case scenario about any little thing. It mainly applies to things I've done wrong. I obsessively worry about outcomes and I actually feel relieved to have an answer even if it's more negative than I was hoping for. If I forget something small at work it consumes me until I get a chance to fix it or apologize for the mistake. 

If I mess up on the same thing twice in a row I kick myself for making the same mistake twice and I worry about the backlash for being dumb when I know I'm not but I can't help worrying what other people think and if it will affect my job. I go over every scenario in the book until my supervisor has a conversation with me about said mistake. I can't convince myself that it will be okay because I always imagine I end up fired even though I know deep down that's ridiculous.

I just need to come up with some coping mechanisms that don't consume me. I worry more about what my superiors think about my mistakes when it ends up that I'm the only one that cares about the mistake. I can't keep coming home from work and worrying about responses to emails that I won't even receive until the next day. I can't stress about meetings for 2 weeks until they actually happen because there is no point to worry about it now.

Stress Hives Common?,"Hey guys, so I have a puzzling one for you. How common are stress hives? I am asking because I recently had what I thought was an allergic reaction to something at work. I broke out in hives and had some swelling.

Anyhow that cleared up and went away, or so I thought. Just this morning I woke up with a small outbreak of hives on my forehead and a swollen left eye to the point where I splashed water on my face to open the eye a little more (thought it was eye crusties).

Anyhow, I am keen to think maybe my body now might react to stress due to hives as I was meant to take the GRE today (the reason I didn't is one of the most bizarre things, but that's for another day) and I'm curious if my body decided to think this heightened level of stress was something that could've harmed me so tried to flare up with hives.

Anyhow, lemme know what you think. I took some Ashwagandha to try to see if it might help the stress/anxiety and it seemed like it, but I always have been a high-stress person (even as a kid) to the point where stress shuts me down mentally. So whenever I take the stuff, I get weirdly emotional because my body can't generate the proper stress response.

Does anyone else have issues with their scalp or skin?,"Lately anytime I use hairspray it burns and stings  my scalp. It happens only on the left side in the area where I typically get the adrenaline surges that heat up my scalp in that area. 

When I get the surges in times of stress, I can actually feel the burning of adrenaline in that area. Like my processor is overheating. t’s very uncomfortable and distressing. It goes up the left side only. 

I suppose those nerve endings and follicles in that area have become hypersensitive since that’s where I feel the burning surge. Sometimes I feel it on my crown. 

I’ve been dealing with burning scalp and skin all through tapering an AD and now that I’ve dropped 4 weeks ago. It’s been so awful and stressful. 

I realize that stress and anxiety is also a factor, but this is actual burning and stinging when I use hairspray. If I but touch my scalp and hair in that area, it is very weird and sensitive. 

My skin on my body is also hypersensitive. When the cool air or wind brush against my skin I cringe. 

Does anyone else have issues like this? 

Btw: I’ve tried paraben free shampoos as well. to see if that’s the issue. I’ve never had this problem before with hairspray stinging. It’s and it’s odd that it’s only in that area where feel the burning brain surges of adrenaline. 
Maybe those nerve endings are super irritated in that area? 

I’ve been to two dermatologist when I had this at the start of my tapering and they just gave me t-gel shampoo and some cortisteroid lotion to use of which both which burned like crazy! So I stopped using it.  

I’ve read that stress and anxiety can cause all kind of skin issues, but I’ve never had stinging from hairspray before. I’ve tried different ones and they ALL sting. But it’s only in that area where I feel those adrenaline surges.

Reduce Holiday Anxiety [5-tips for success!],"Link to the original video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r-M1gzKDb8

Here are five tips to help you reduce your holiday anxiety. Number 1. Don’t invite people known to cause trouble at your holiday gathering.

If you have someone on your holiday guest list who is known to cause trouble. For example, starts fights, shows up high, or insists on talking about politics or other difficult topics. don’t invite them to your gathering. Attending holiday gatherings is a privilege. Do what’s right for you by not inviting discord into your event. The same is true for events you are invited. You do not need to go to a party or event that makes you uncomfortable.

Number 2. Create a budget and stick to it!

Money, or the lack of it, is a major source of stress during the holiday season. Whether it’s purchasing gifts or spending on decorations and parties, the holidays can get expensive. Set a budget and stick to it. Avoid impulse shopping. There’s no need to tempt yourself by browsing items you don’t have the funds to buy. No matter how you choose to budget for the holidays, setting a budget and sticking to it will reduce your holiday stress levels.

Number 3. Simplify!

Another source of stress during the holidays is doing too much. If you need a vacation from your vacation, it isn’t much of a rest period. Do you really have to do everything on your list? Do you decorate every room in the house because you want to? or because others believe you should. If it brings you joy to decorate every room in the house, by all means do it. But if you are doing tasks out of expectation, consider downsizing.

Number 4. Remember the Reason for the Season!

Your stress may decrease if you keep focused on why we do what we do at this time of year. Perhaps you are a religious person who connects with your holidays as a time of awe or renewal. You may be more secular and experience this as a time to be with family and friends. For some, this may be a time of year that reminds you of difficult experiences, so you may need to reach out and find new positive meaning for the season. Whatever your beliefs, focus on what’s important to you, rather than tasks and being busy. Doing activities that have meaning will help reduce your anxiety…

And number 5. Practice gratitude.

Perhaps most important, the holiday season provides an opportunity to spend time thinking about all that we have to be grateful for. family, friends, meaningful work, and more. When we are able to see what we have, rather than fixate on what we don’t, some of our anxiety will give way to love, grace, and hope.",Jatopia,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/rf16gj/reduce_holiday_anxiety_5tips_for_success/,0

What’s wrong with me? Is this normal or am I overstressed?,"Hi everyone. I don’t know what’s going on with me lately but I feel annoyed easily and want to cry a lot. Housework feels like a constant nag that has to be done and is never finished and even though my partner helps me it still feels never ending and I resent that. I work full time doing lates one week and earlies the other week. I feel anxious before the afternoon shift because I’m constantly clock watching and I have to do chores and errands and have little time to unwind and make time for hobbies. The early shift I don’t sleep well and after 8 hours of physical labour I have no motivation to dust and hoover my home because I feel tired and bored by the thought. Also there’s usually other chores which have to be done. The weekends are also full of chores and food shopping which has to be done. And on top of cleaning, cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, errands there’s Christmas to deal with and the thought of making time for that instead of slowing down and taking time for me is making me feel sad and resentful. I just want to please myself and live a calm and contented life but the everyday tasks are too much and have to be done. Am I lazy? Am I depressed? Or is this just good old life and I have to suck it up? Plus it doesn’t help that I work for a bad company who doesn’t look after it’s workers so maybe that’s not helping my mental state? I wish I could spend hours on hobbies and relax. I made time for baking last weekend whilst doing chores but I ended up hating it because I had to clean up and it was time consuming. I normally enjoy baking but not on this occasion. Please help. Any insight to help me would be appreciated.

intense emotions,"intense emotions

Is it normal to feel emotions really intensely and be deeply effected by them? For example, sometimes I feel like i’m suffocation whenever i’m nervous about something, my heart racing and feel i start feeling out of control. Stress effects me the same way .

i don’t have a good reason about being nervous , it’s usually about small things . But it still really effects me, and i don’t know what to do about it. I often have this sick feeling, like something bad is going to happen. Or whenever i smell the fresh winter air i get sick to my stomach, somewhat in a good way. I also feel intense when i’m happy , i feel like my heart is bursting .
Also, i don’t often get angry . Still, not so long ago i had this incident with a friend . What basically happened is that i felt like they were trying to avoid me on purpose and for some reason this really ticked me off, it flipped a switch in my brain. i ran after them , and pushed them . not so hard that they fell, but still pretty hard . Then i went on to call them a bitch. whoops …..

"Losing my mind by stressing over a calc class, don’t know how to stop","I’m a high schooler right now, and am applying to college. I’m taking Multivariable calculus (a college level math course) right now, and the only way for me to end with an A in the class is if I get a 97-100 on the next two tests.

I can’t keep my mind from worrying about this. Every time I think about the class, I just want to throw up. I liked math before this, but I’m also taking an extremely rigorous course load, have so many extra things I do outside of school, and giving my 120% to each activity is just draining me. Sleeping is the best thing and only thing I want to do bc I’m so mentally drained.

I just don’t know how to keep going. I have 1.5 weeks left in this calculus class. How do I continue the grind when I’m this exhausted and study efficiently? I have finals coming up, so I really need advice.

To top this off, my parents’ yelling and screaming makes me want to cry. Not makes me, it has made me. I’ve been crying so much lately because of them, because of this stress, and I had a breakdown the other day. 

I know I can grind and make sure that I do good on the tests. But how? How do I keep going on like this, when everything is pulling me down? These past weeks have definitely been one of the hardest in my (short) life.

Feeling very stressed out.,"Going through a very stressful time, it’s mostly financial which feels out of my control because I don’t make enough money to pay things off fast enough. 

Over covid I couldn’t afford to pay my student loans, I also lost my wallet at one point and ended up closing my old bank account and going with a new larger bank. When I finally went back to check on it my student loan was in collections. I sent money in, talked to someone on the phone about it and sent another payment in and thought everything was sorted. I just checked and both payments are not showing up and it says I haven’t paid anything for almost a year still. My credit card bill is getting higher as I had to put that off to make my loan deadlines which I was fine with doing but now I feel like my money has just been sent to space and I don’t know where it is. 

I also promised to help my partner with some bills and still need to get them a Christmas present and I just feel like I’m drowning at this point. On top of all of that I have to go for an medical exam  because I found a lump which is really scaring me and I have to take time off for the appointment and I feel like my boss has been getting annoyed with me.

"I have been physically sick for almost a year, and I don't know what is up","Hello,

for context, I am a 23 year old male living a student life. Before the pandemic, I never had stress problems. I have always been a very positive and active person. Even though my field of study requires a LOT of study, I never felt stressed about it. I enjoy what I do and I spend a lot of time with friends, prioritizing social life.

Everything changed last year when I was doing my master program fully online back at home with my family. The master program I did is renowned for being extremely time consuming, and I studied all year at home by myself without being able to go out much. That being said, I don't think I ever felt stressed out, but I guess it is important to acknowledge that what I did was very time and mentally consuming.

Approximately a year ago (November 2020), I started having what one may call panic attacks. I would feel my brain foggy, and start having heart palpitations. Once I was home alone and I started feeling extremely weak and had a feeling of passing out (never did pass out). From that day, everything went downhill.  I was constantly afraid of having another one of those attacks. At first I did not think any of that was related to stress, I thought I was sick somehow and there was some underlying health problem. I would CONSTANTLY feel a pressure in my stomach, as if my stomach was extremely tense in a specific spot (to be precise, under the chest at the starting of the stomach). Sometimes, I would also feel a weird tingling sensation in my head and experience bad headaches. I also had problems going to the bathroom, and I got hemorroids multiple times in that period.

For about 2-3 months, I started doing an insane number of medical tests (blood, x-rays, MRI scans, gastroscopy, heart checks, etc..). Basically, literally any conceivable test someone may do. I know what you are thinking. That I am a hypochondriac. Honestly, at that time, I may have been. I was so SURE there was something wrong with me that I could not POSSIBLY think stress may have caused all of that. I became OBSESSED with finding what was wrong with me.

Once all the test results got back negative, I accepted the idea that I may have had a stress problem. I tried to keep my mind busy and see friends, and although it got much better over time, It never went back to normal. During the summer, I did a big holiday trip with my best friends and I had a lot of fun. However, in one way or another, I kept having the symptoms described above (tight stomach, brain fogginess and tingling, etc).

What I have noticed is that these symptoms are stronger when I am alone, and especially outside of the house. When I am with friends or doing other stuff, the symptoms are much milder and sometime completely go away.

A year now has passed. Mentally, I feel fine. I am happy and I have lots of friends. I want to do so many things! But somehow, my body keeps fighting me. It is extremely frustrating. All I want is get back a normal life like I had before, but it seems impossible and I am scared this thing is gonna haunt me for a long time.

Does anybody relate to the symptoms and stuff I described above? If so, what do you all recommend I could do to try to solve this problem once and for all?

my family think they are helping.but they are making my mental health worse,"hi!

-my name is Mustapha.I'm 17 years old and I'm from tunisia.today I'm gonna talk about something that is shady and it's bothering me for awhile and it's about my family.so there are some things that I wont rly explain cuz I will leave them for some next messages.

-so here is the subject.i have depression since 2017 (that doesn't mean I didnt enjoy things over the years)and it is caused by some bullying from school and many problems by my own father.and due to all of this pressure,my education has fallen so terribly over the years.and now we are 2021 and I left school.not because of bullying.cuz school did make my mental health worse.i didn't have patient to sit in class and wait for like 8 hours to do something that I love.i was like ""what's the point of learning something that I know I won't use in the future.while I can just leave.take care of my mental health in anytime and doing my hobby"".but did that plan go well.no,and the reason is that my family did not support me at all for leaving school.they didn't even support me when I I was in school and not studying.basicaly,they did abuse me mentally,sometimes physically and here are some best examples of what I mean by ""mentally abuse"":

-""you will be like the people of our town.who take drugs and jobless""

-""If you don't know what you will do for your future.you are gonna be nothing""

-""without any college degree or any type of studying or not doing some money business.you are failure""

-""depression isn't an excuse for doing nothing""

-""at least go open our arcade area to be useful at something in your life""

-""you will be a bad person like your father""

-""your hobby is nothing without studying""


-now here is where I call my family idiots.if they already know how my depression went before and how my father is the one that started everything.and I had bullying in the middle school.i also had anxiety, stress for no reason at all.why in the hell they think by comparing me to the person that I hate the most will fix things like my education or my mental health and why the hell would they try to compare me to people that are doing drugs or people that are studying.and even after I told them that this will not fix anything.it will make things worse.but they didn't listen.and some things got worse now I always can't do my hobby or play video games or listening to music comfortable anymore.their voices,their words,my past,my all bad moments are stuck in my head.playing all over again.i can't even control myself to focus on the task.i told my therapist about how they are telling me all of this stuff.but guess what it didn't work cuz she literally called my mother and told her that ""I am lazy cuz i don't want to do anything"".i have antidepressants to ""help"" me with depression.but tbh they weren't rly useful.here is my biggest problem when my therapist told my mother that I'm lazy.now would you call laziness if a teenage boy suffering from depression for 5 straight years and had multiple suicidal thoughts,injured himself out of anger,dealt with fake friends,trauma,toxic people,toxic environment and felt confused,lost cuz sometimes he doesn't know what he wants,what is missing in his life,doesn't wake up early cuz he has insomnia for so long that he forgot when he woke up at least 11 am last time,left school cuz when he is always there he feels he is gonna lose his mind cuz he can't stand what he is learning.. .i will let you decide who is the right and who is the wrong.

-you see what I mean by all of this.i sometimes feel like they are trying to make me a villian or acused for making my self depressed and whenever I can't find an excuse for my own depression.im guilty.i did try things like training but they didn't rly make me feel better or something.and everyday when my family want me to open the ""arcade area"" for them to gain money cuz my brothers are studying (although they always caring for business)they seem suspicious.I feel I am being used or something.here is an example there was one time where I didn't eat launch and had nobody to come for me so I can go and eat.it was like 8pm.i decided to leave one of the clients which he is old and we know for a very long time and when I got home.my brothers got angry and telling me things like ""you idiot.why did you do that"".another example and most obvious one is that my mother wants me to sleep early cuz ""for my mental health"".but for the most part it's about their business.and when I do open the arcade area late or I don't want to open it.she starts to get angry at me and tell me some things and always takes my phone away.and when I do open it early.she acts normal.

-so what do I think of my family?well tbh they do care for my future but they did it in a very wrong way  cuz I don't want to rush things so quickly.i am starting my hobby small and then it gets bigger.but my family want results.they don't care about progress.they don't even know what my hobby means for me.although i kinda have some fun with them.but their words and everything are stuck in my mind.and over the years I rly lost my trust and respect for them.I don't feel I care about them that much like when I used to as a kid.they rly did tell me some shady things by my own hobby.and I do feel betrayed and mad about that.i know this was rly long message.but what should I do in this situation? How can I ignore their insults? how can I be less nervous and anxious? how to make my self be happy if things like training and meditation don't work? and how can I have a passion for my hobby 100 percent again without stress?

thanks for your advice.peace🙏",nooobsdza,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/r052c2/my_family_think_they_are_helpingbut_they_are/,0

basically school or some shit,"So ever since online school began I have just hated it, but I was at least eventually in person in a really good school. Then we moved and now we're at a bad school, one with bad kids, dumb rules and a lot of passive aggressive asshole teachers. Recently I thought it was over when I started moving around and getting more exercise but it's come back.

These past few weeks, I have just been having a gut feeling that things are going to suck and already it's going downhill, my grades are still good but I am letting too much shit slide and that is not all. I have all sorts of things happening throughout the next month since its almost break season (AKA Thanksmas) and I fear as I get older it will only get worse. 

I still feel great at home, I do well in hygiene, making sure I work on my activeness and outside time, filming Youtube videos, drawing and plotting chart data. My main passion is YouTube though, I have had many channels but never had the time to commit to them, but being at home has helped, especially since I now know how to manage my time well at home. And school which only stresses me out, is getting in the way and its beginning to weigh on me, but if I do anything to try and not go I am fucked and will have no life if YouTube doesn't take off.

[Academic] Participants wanted for a short online study: Stress and Attention - Examining the Cognitive Impacts of Chronic Stress on Attention (open to everyone 18+),"Hi all,

Apologies in advance if this is not okay to post here but I am recruiting for my MRes study on chronic stress and attention.

**The study**

Comprises an attention measuring task and two short questionnaires about stress and anxiety. It should take approximately 10 minutes to complete. All participants will receive their own unique link to the study, so please comment or message me if you are interested and I will send you the Info Sheet and study link (I'll need an email address). Study is being carried out as part of my MRes at the University of Liverpool. All participant data will be anonymised and held securely (your Participant Information Sheet should cover everything you need to know before you commit to taking part, but I am of course more than happy to answer questions)

There are no exclusion criteria apart from that you must be aged over 18.

Because of how the attention task works, this study can't be completed using a touch screen; you will need to be using a device with a physical keyboard.

**A bit of background:**

Chronic stress is known to affect physical and mental health, but it can also have a dramatic impact on attention and cognitive performance in ways that remain poorly understood. This can have negative consequences in everyday life and in the workplace, where stress-induced failures of attention can reduce performance, productivity, and safety – sometimes with fatal consequences. However, we know incredibly little about individual differences in attention function across the general population. This study aims to increase our understanding of how stress affects human attention and cognitive performance.

Is this a symptom of stress?,"For the past few months I have been quite stressed over a move in life. This included an apartment move. And in this current unit, my neighbors are terrible! They’re home 24/7 and I work from home, so I’m also home 98% of the time dealing with CONSTANT daytime noise due to kids running around + big dog in the same unit. It is annoying beyond words and I have almost no quiet time during the day. Nights are a little better fortunately. But anyway, the excessive noise causes an enormous burst of angry feelings and stress about the noise. And there’s not much I can do. 

About 2 months ago I started developing more tinnitus tones after having only one constant tone my whole life. More have come since. Some stick around while others come and go. But lately I’ve had what feels like a low frequency hum tone in my left ear. I sometimes feel it in my brain but it feels like my eardrum is vibrating. It’s like a car was left idling in the distance and the rumble is muffled by the walls. I sometimes feel it in the side of my face and head and even the left side of my body will sometimes feel tingly. I’m constantly stressed about it even when it’s quieter knowing I’m not at peace in my own home. I struggle with anxiety and especially health anxiety so I hope the vibrating low tone hum and sensation is related to this and not something more serious.

PSA,"I recently (like August) started taking anxiety medication.m, which made my stress symptoms (overthinking, clenching teeth, irritability, and insomnia) pretty much a thing of the past.

The Work Abuse and Trauma.,"I can't wait to get to know who I am again. I have lost myself in the extreme stress I have endured for so long. When I look in the mirror, I don't even know my face anymore. I used to just paint my face as best as I could every day to cover up the sadness and exhaustion I felt, while worrying about the war and chaos I was about to walk into each day. That is, if I didn't ovesleep from exhaustion. Then I would hastily put on some clothes I could find laying around, and drive to that dungeon of a job. 

I would spend every ounce of enegy at this job. I used to wake up at the last minute for work. My heart would be pounding. I would sleep 3-4 hours a night, the more short staffed we became... Hungover every day because I drank to cope with the inhumane amount of stress, red eyes, legs feeling like jello, my left leg went numb, I would violently shake and sob while feeling so weak from barely eating... I just had to survive another day there. Just one more day, I would tell myself. Just one more day, one more day, one more day. I knew how much my friends would suffer if I wasn't there for even just one day, I tried to put in my two weeks in with the owner... I was so sure in my mind that I was done because of how much I was physically and mentally suffering. We were alone in his office for over an hour.. I told him I was suicidal, beyond anxious, physically ill from the stress that is put on me... And he covered it up with praise and compliments to me. Asked me to give him just ONE more chance. The new girl would be the savior of the day (even though everyone quits almost immediately after starting.) They are immediately overworked from the moment they start. If they don't quit immediately, then it's after a month. If it's not after a month, it's because they feel so stuck there and manipulated that they can't ever leave because they see no other option for themselves, and because they see other people suffering so deeply. And because of the manipulation and guilting that comes from the operations manager and owner. They didn't show me any emotions or care.

 I took maybe 3-4 sick days in almost two years and NO VACATIONS while I worked there. The operations manager took over a week vacation just the other week... A staycation where she knew we were all suffering immensely with almost no staff. Twice while I worked there. She guilted people into not taking vacations, she made me call and text the poor workers to come in on their day off EVERY FUCKING Week when they were already so maxed out. She wanted me to look like the bad guy. She would talk about them like they are putrid animals who are lazy and don't deserve a break while they are killing themselves for this FUCKING business. When I told that bitch that I had put in my two weeks with the owner, and that no amount of bribing, guilting, begging, pleading, sucking up to, anger, and compliments from him would stop me... I was sobbing and shaking in fear of her. I told her how much I care about them, but how no amount of money he offers me, and how nothing will stop me. I was so sick that I was only functioning on the last bit of strength my body offered me every day. and she looked at me with disgust and a piercing venomous stare that made my blood boil.

 But, I had already been so sick to my stomach shaking and crying, chest pain from my heart racing for so long, and weakness in my body entirely, that I could not stand up to her in that moment. All she said was, ""Well can't you just stay for AT LEAST another month? Now ALL of your work is going to fall ON MY SHOULDERS. I'm going to have to hire people LIKE CRAZY."" and then she looked at me with anger, rolling her eyes. I was sobbing and shaking the whole time, and I told her how sorry I was for that, but no way. I need to stand up for myself. And I told her that maybe I'm not mentally strong enough for this job, and that I'm replaceable. Didn't know what other approach to take. And she shrugged her shoulders and rolled her eyes with annoyance. And I told her that if the owner were to cut his clients in half, it would make me reconsider. She angrily told me, ""Well thats how we make our money."" 
I said,  ""OK, well I would need things to drastically change if I was to ever reconsider staying at this place."" 
Theres no way. Everyone quits so fast. That woman hires people off of the streets. Anyone who's willing to make us to  survive just one more day. 
And then these poor new workers come in with a bright excited smile, and they see me, looking beyond overwhelmed. As the office manager. Along with the few people holding that business together. 

It was a running joke... ""just give it to Vivian."" the operations manager would say. Just give it to Vivian. Just give it to Vivian, JUST GIVE IT TO VIVIAN. while she piles all of the work on me while she got to leave early every day and go on the road every single week near the end. She'd say,"" oh it's not like I enjoy going on a the road, going on death calls."" As she would attempt to conceal that sly smirk of hers. It is so much easier than being stuck in that building like I always was. This place works for every funeral home in the state, soooo many out of state funeral homes, other countries, the donation companies in this state and many out of state too which I had to do ALL of the death certificates for. I had at least 30 at a time on EDRS. Because I tried to complete all of them on time. I get in trouble with the state if it's not done fast enough. 
And then the Muslim burial funeral home that I had to do all of the death certificates for. I got new death calls from the owner of that place, who treated his families like garbage, who treated my drivers with complete disrespect. I once broke the rules and called him to yell at him about how angry I was about how he treats my drivers when he should be yelling AT ME. THE OFFICE MANAGER WHO DISPATCHES MY FEW DRIVERS on millions of calls. He would steal at least one of the few drivers I had for his all day runs. 
I had to complete all of his Death Certificates within 24 hours of the decedent's death. Meaning, I had to call the doctors and harass them over and over again to sign those stupid death certificates. A lot of the doctors not knowing HOW TO EVEN LOG ONTO EDRS. So I had to teach them. A lot of these death certificates were deaths in King County. I had to get a DA number. A disposition authorization number. Often having to call the medical examiners to get it for me, while I had to send my proof copy of the death certificate vitals after typing them up while I have ten people on hold, a desk FULL of files and papers... A million other death certificates with many other angry funeral homes calling me to yell at me for not making them a number one priority. 

 And calls every second of the day with many specific requests, to do things for every one of the MANY MANY MANY MANYYYYY clients. Some of them were so kind and understanding to me. My friends. But they had to do their jobs too. It wasn't their fault thay I was beyond overwhelmed, sobbing almost every day in the office, trying to contain myself in front of the many clients and families that would call, and my drivers. Some of the clients and families would be so upset because they thought I was slacking on my job... When in reality, there wasn't NEAR enough time in the day. Oh.. There's so much more. I had to dispatch the very few drivers I had to work with, on millions of calls... Planning their entire routes while dealing with much more than what I have explained so far. It was a changing puzzle every minute of the day with all of the calls to deal with on my own. The new death calls that would come in so often, it would make me so angry that I had to put them and every other person on hold to THROW MY PEN AND PAPERS AROUND THE ROOM while I was alone in the building, also while many clients would come into the building with tons and tons of new dead bodies for me to deal with on my own. While having to deal with everything in the office.. And the other millions of death certificates and EMAILS. Emails, emails, emails, emails. Every 5 seconds a new one. I got so used to doing at least 20 things at once and I got so good at it without making mistakes. I was almost flawless. And there was one funeral home who would bring in 4-10 bodies at a time, piling all of the bodies on top of each other... Which is illegal by the way. It was the fault of the funeral directors that made the poor drivers do it. Also the same people who constantly belittled and yelled at me on the phone, and in the emails. The CAPS LOCK they would use for emphasis, directed at me. ""I CANNOT DO MY JOB IF YOU DON'T DO YOURS!!!!!!!!!"" 

Because the owner and operations manager were too lazy to deal with it,  they made me do it. Something about this job makes you want to kill yourself and sell your soul to save the company. What the actual fuck is this. And your well being. Your happiness. There were always many funeral homes bringing in many bodies one after the other after the other, after the other, while the phone would ring off the hook and I'd have to run back and forth. With the few seconds I had, I would spend time pulling out so many bodies out of the coolers, just to make room for one more and stuff it in there or put it on the floor. Stuff it in there like a sausage. Because I didn't have a damn choice. With how many bodies I've seen, how many overdoses, suicides, illness, covid, hangings, shotgun wounds, getting run over by a giant truck, mother son car accidents, murder suicides, drownings, decomposed bodies, nicely embalmed bodies with sweet families taking care and putting a beautiful hat or earrings, or whatever was meaningful to them, the ones that were dead in their house or the lake for weeks... Months... Eventually I felt no empathy for all of them. It took a lot for me to feel empathy for them after so long of running on almost no energy left. I lost it all. Because of how sick I was, I couldn't bring myself to feel normal human emotions anymore. 
Because I couldn't survive there while also feeling empathy for the deceased. I just had to find a way to find space for all of them on my own in three giant coolers with 700+ bodies, being short staffed, crying, suffering, almost vomiting daily from the stress. Until I had one or two people arrive for their shift to help me. Then I could go to the bathroom and cry in peace. Or go cry with the other few people we had after they had had enough in that building as well. 
The operations manager was absolutely no help until I asked her questions on how to do something because she refused to get up off of her ass to help everyone that was suffering. 

 It hurts so badly that my coworkers are still there, now suffering much worse because I'm not there to protect them anymore. 

OH, also, I used to take death certificates home with me because I got in trouble for not getting all of them done on time. I had an impossible amount to do on my own.. She used to pretend to care about me and not wanting me to do them at home... But eventually, when I asked her again, she said, ""it's OK Vivian, I didn't hear that."" and just looked at me with approval. The abuse wasn't apparent until I started getting so sick physically and mentally ill that it took sheer willpower to make it through one day before I would collapse and then sit in the corner of my bed in the dark, in my room. Just shaking and crying uncontrollably.

My biggest wish, is for thay business to collapse and fall to the ground. I hope they all get out and survive. Like I finally am now.",CarefulLibrarian2063,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/qsynau/the_work_abuse_and_trauma/,0
Stress/ anxiety or something else?," I’ve been feeling this busied sensation/ pain since about 2-3 weeks postpartum (baby is 11 weeks tomorrow) 
It’s worse at night. And is sometimes painful when I breath in. I mentioned this at my postpartum check, and the nurse just said that it just sounds like anxiety? I mean yes I’ll admit it’s been pretty high since birth. And some days are worse than others. However on days where I’m less anxious the pain is still there? I’m wondering what your options are or what your experiences were? Did/ do you have something similar? This is my third baby and I never had This with the other two? Is it worth getting a second opinion? Or is this quite common post birth? Or is it just my anxiety? Any input / advice is greatly appreciated. Thankyou.

A study casts light on the working mechanisms of non-directive meditation that contributes to stress management,"This is a copy of a post from Nootropics from some time ago that I think should still be of interest:

Nondirective meditation activates default mode network and areas associated with memory retrieval and emotional processing (February 2014)

Nondirective meditation techniques are practiced with a relaxed focus of attention that permits spontaneously occurring thoughts, images, sensations, memories, and emotions to emerge and pass freely, without any expectation that mind wandering should abate. These techniques are thought to facilitate mental processing of emotional experiences, thereby contributing to wellness and stress management. The present study assessed brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 14 experienced practitioners of Acem meditation in two experimental conditions. In the first, nondirective meditation was compared to rest. Significantly increased activity was detected in areas associated with attention, mind wandering, retrieval of episodic memories, and emotional processing. In the second condition, participants carried out concentrative practicing of the same meditation technique, actively trying to avoid mind wandering. The contrast nondirective meditation &gt; concentrative practicing was characterized by higher activity in the right medial temporal lobe (parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala). In conclusion, the present results support the notion that nondirective meditation, which permits mind wandering, involves more extensive activation of brain areas associated with episodic memories and emotional processing, than during concentrative practicing or regular rest.

Shakti mats released my stress (dealing with intellectualisation),"So for about a year I haven't been able to release any of my stress and have been totally emotionally numb, unable to feel happiness or sadness. I tend to intellectualise all my thoughts so I could never properly feel/release the emotions as they got hijacked by my reasoning/thoughts.   
I bought a shakti mat and I sat with the pain on it and I just couldn't stop laughing. As I was sitting with the pain I would have the stressful thoughts in my life go through my mind, but rather than dwell and stress over it, I just found myself laughing in tears and feeling all the stress go away. I imagine that sitting with the pain prevented me from intellectualising and forced me to be present with the stress, and the laughing was the release.  
I've tried meditating, exercising, socialising, youtube videos.. etc over the year, and this was the only thing that has worked for me so far. This is because even with all these activities I couldn't overcome the thoughts running through my head (and believe me I've tried very hard).  


TL;DR: Shakti mats forced me to be present with thoughts in my head and release the emotions.",thewizzkid97,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/qnrjpr/shakti_mats_released_my_stress_dealing_with/,0

Piano Rant,"My piano teacher got really harsh with me after I just got back from a 1 month trip from the hospital. She started stressing me out really bad. Keep in mind I had weekly lessons for years. All with the same teacher. She was always super nice and understanding. It was my first month back, and when I didnt get the notes right, she said she was going to start crying because I didnt get it. Making me stressed, and guilty since I felt bad for hurting her feelings. When she started crying I started crying out of guilt for making her cry. This has never happene before, and I was fresh out of a huge hospital visit. I was stressed as fuck already, had to catch up on a month of school, and I didnt want a repeat of that because thinking about it gave me anxiety. I quit piano after that (guiltily, because my mom had been paying for lessons for years and seemed to be very passionate about it) and havent played for years.Were having 4 guests over for Christmas, and my mom wants me to play a 2 hand song over piano for all of them, plus herself and my dad, knowing that I havent played since I quit. Even if I wanted too, im way to busy with school, and bringing up my failing math grade before the semester ends. Even thinking about it makes me want to have a meltdown because ive always had anxiety about doing things in front of people, leading to me never joining clubs, plus the whole piano teacher incident.

[Repost] [Academic] Physical Manifestations of Stress Survey (US 18-65),"Hello lovely people! I am reposting this one last time because I'm just THREE PARTICIPANTS SHORT of our 1,000 participant goal. It would mean the world to me if you could take this survey. We especially are hoping to get a few more participants in the 40-65 age range.

Our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh is conducting a research study to measure how people experience stress. If you are between the ages of 18-65 years old and a US citizen or resident, you are eligible to participate! The study involves filling out some questionnaires about how stress manifests itself in your body. Depending on your unique stress response, the survey could take as little as 5 minutes or up to approximately 15 minutes to complete. To compensate you for completing the survey, you can choose to have your name entered for the opportunity to receive an iPad. You may also elect to do the survey as a volunteer without compensation (i.e., without having your name entered to receive an iPad).

Some respondents may be invited to fill out the survey a second time at a later date, and will again have the opportunity to receive compensation.

life is stressing me out,"everythings stressing me out. 

my parents never had a good relationship and finally got a divorce a couple years ago and now both have found their own gf/bf. which isnt the problem the problem is they both will still come to me and talk shit about how the other was such a shitty person and will come and complain about the relationships theyre currently in. 

not to mention my mom is trying to get remarried but my little sister lives with her and is not comfortable with the idea of having to live with a random man for the next couple of years (she just turned 13) and my mom keeps telling me to go and convince her. 

my parents are also very immature narcissistic and childish my dad will come home and will slam his door and not talk to me for weeks if i did something to slightly displease him or disagree with him cause he thinks hes always right. 

my mom constantly takes money out of my bank and makes me pay for her credit card bills saying i have a lot of money even tho i dont work and have to pay for my own college bills since she told me that i have a lot of money saved up and can pay for my own college bills even tho i dont even have more than 5k in my bank account and she has a lot of money sent to her by her parents and saved up from working  and i cant even work even if i wanted to due to not having US work authorization (my parents are able to work). 

theres so many other stress factors too other then these like schools so stressful right now and having to pick my little sister up from school even tho i have school work to do is also really stressful. 

also with my health problems it makes it harder to juggle all these problems. i have endometriosis which causes me pain almost on a daily basis and have a brain problem that requires me to get a brain surgery every 4 years and constantly puts me at a risk for a stroke.

im only 20 and i feel like my life is being wasted living like this. 

i just want a break…

I have tachycardia, palpitations, trembling andhave severe panic attacks which make me feel as if i'm gonna die. this happened a lot during my exams. I had a panic attack during my math exam which affected my chemistry paper too as there was a fifteen minute break between the two.

The chest pain was excruciating. Ik these questions very well and I solved them but because of this condition I messed up my grade bcs of this. I feel so drained. The fact that i knew how to solve the questions pains me. I did this in all of my exams because of these panic attacks. I used to score 50/50 in one of my math components and this time the paper was easier than the previous years but I lost so many marks because of this.

The James Horner approach?,"In the extras of the DVD release of *Aliens* (1986), composer James Horner describes how he composed his way into hospital for the movie, causing damage to his back because he 'embodied' the tense music he was writing for the movie.

Horner then said that he afterwards got some training to make sure that the tension would be in his *music* for future commissions, and not *in his body*, though he didn't explain much about this process.

I have been thinking about this the last ten days, as I've been intermittently laid up with a mouth ulcer so painful that I'm unable to do my job (writing articles about AI and machine learning).

First I would rest a day, and the mouth ulcer abated. Then the next day I would be all 'Right! Time to get back to it'. And I'd get back to it. The following day, the ulcer would be back, and I'd be laid up again, consumed with the pain.

This happened four times before I finally realized that every time I would work for more than an hour, I would resurrect the mouth ulcer for a full 24 hours afterwards.

And it made me realize what my work (that I love!) is doing to my body; the coffee, the competitiveness, the inner spur to achieve...all these seemed like good things to me, and I love it when it's going well, and I'm doing good work and getting results.

Yet, the fact that I have this temporary Litmus test in my mouth makes me realize the hammering I am giving my body, just seated and writing and engaging in 'useful' stress. 

I'm currently forcing myself to lie down and just watch movies and TV all day. I've put my web browser back on just to post this, but more than twenty minutes even of online activity seems enough to re-provoke the mouth ulcer (it's going down, and I have medication, and plenty of the appropriate vitamins, etc.). 

I hope to start work again next Monday, so long as the ulcer is *completely* gone by then (since it can rise back up like a mustard seed).

Anyway, I wonder if anyone here has done as James Horner did, and found a way to do excellent work and 'keep the tension' in the work and not the body...? If so - how?

Using Sleep and Gut Health to Combat Stress,"Sleep. It is difficult not to love good sleep, but our current lifestyle is making it increasingly harder for us to get the right amount of restful hours. And when we do find the time, pests like anxiety and stress, mean we're taking ages to dose off. Interrupted sleep is also an issue for city sleepers. What if we can somehow find a way to improve our relationship with sleep...through the gut?

That’s right; recent scientific findings have concluded that there is a link between gut health and sleep. Here are some fascinating facts about the link about sleep and gut health.

**Lack of Sleep Increases Stress:** this leads to a hormone imbalance within the gut, causing cortisol (stress hormone) levels to rise. This can also lead to a leaky gut, where food and toxins are able to pass through the intestine and into the bloodstream which causes bloating and inflammation.

**Eating too Close to Bedtime:** as opposed to resting, our body becomes absorbed with digestion and absorption while sleeping, leading to restless sleep that leaves us feeling more tired and lethargic in the morning. 

So how do we break this toxic cycle? Prioritising our gut health would be a start and consuming natural extracts will be an effective and risk free way to bring about positive change. Konjac Root has been proven to regulate bowel movements which helps to cleanse the colon and small intestines and this has had a positive impact on my mood! It has also benefitted me when I took it and I feel a lot lighter as a result during the day. During the night? Well, you'll be pleased to hear that the quality of my sleep has also improved and it is safe to say that I have definitely broken the cycle!

I can't figure out what is wrong with me.,"Ever since covid came to this world and changed everything. I haven't had the motivation to do anything. I got my certification to work a month before covid started but when it got big our work stopped for a year. And ever since then I can't find any motivation to work. Now that I'm able to work again I just can't find the joy of it anymore even tho I really want to do it and get better at it, I was super excited to work and do everything I can that month I got my certification but now it's like I have no reason/motivation to want to do it.

 I also always bring up all these ideas on how to improve my work but I just don't know how to start or where to start. Nothing is pushing me to start. And even then I had business ideas to do on the side and they all seemed fun I did tons of research for all these different side gigs to start but when it came to starting I never did it. 

Even with hobbies there has probably been like 10 hobbies I thought of doing but yet I never start them

Something is preventing me from moving forward on trying new things. But I can't seem to find out why I'm ""stuck"" in this position.",Firelocon1,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/qgkxnr/i_cant_figure_out_what_is_wrong_with_me/,1

Monitoring your breathing habits,"Hi all!

I'm working on a startup that is developing a device that helps people train their breathing habits (i.e. a digital breathing coach). We don't have anything to sell but we are trying to learn about what would be useful for people who are interested in breathing habits / benefits / techniques.

If you have just 2 minutes to spare, it would be fantastically useful for us and much appreciated if you could answer a few Google Form questions about breathing habits:

Coping with Irrational/Paranoid thoughts??,"I’m so stressed out. My cat passed away last month and my dog just passed two days ago. It hurts so badly but I’m trying to get through it. 
I have a kitten who got sick just yesterday and I’m freaking out. She’s eating, sleeping, drinking, using the bathroom- but her behavior is just off. My family is getting annoyed with me because I can’t stop stressing out about it. I’m trying to, I’m really trying to find other things to think about. But I can’t stop thinking that she’s going to die. I work with the elderly, I deal with death all the time, I don’t know why I can’t wrap my head around this. Part of me knows it’s irrational- but only because my family keeps trying to tell me that she’s doing fine. They’re saying she just wants to be left alone, she just wants to sleep. But my kitten isn’t like that. She’s rowdy, she wants to play all the time. She’s not lethargic like this, this isn’t normal behavior for her. Idk. Idk what to do, or how to keep myself from thinking she’s dying right now. I’m so scared. My therapist quit her job to go to school for nursing last month or I would call her to try to find some kind of coping method.

"A quick, step-by-step morning routine - with Notion","An almost compulsory part of any self-care blog or YouTube series is the (im)famous morning routine.  And you know the drill, it usually includes a combination of the following:

1. Cold shower

2. Black coffee

3. Walk in the park

4. Journaling

5. Meditation

And although they are all great practices, doing them all, consistently, every single day in the part of the day when you’re arguably the most sleepy, is difficult. So people tend to get discouraged and don’t even try anymore.

However, I have found that in my personal experience, a complicated multi-step morning routine really isn’t useful in the long term. [In this article](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/morning-routine), I will show you the quick and simple way I start my day, with which I get all the benefits of a complicated morning routine.

Job + School Stress = It all feels like too much,"Right now I am in the last year of my master's program, finally finishing out 24 years of straight school, which means I am going to school full-time until the beginning of May. On top of that at the beginning of August, I began my first adult job in my intended career path working 40 hour weeks. 

Before this job, I never worked more than a couple of summers part-time and held a part-time student job on campus during my undergrad. So going from barely ever working to working full time in a corporate position has been very very hard. I don't know how to communicate, I feel stupid constantly asking for help, I don't want to reveal to all of my bosses and colleagues how inexperienced I am (even though they know I am still a student). All of my bosses give me high praises on everything I work on which is good I guess, but they don't know how much I struggle behind the scenes.

Not only that but it is a very autonomous position and I feel like I can never stay focused during work hours thus always extending my work into the night and over the weekends in order to meet deadlines. Because of this, I feel like I am constantly at work. I have not had a day unincumbered by both schoolwork and work work in three weeks, and feel like I am losing my mind. I am constantly stressed, constantly tired, and I cannot let anyone know because then it will reveal how truly awful I am as an employee.

Update on a thread I made almost 5 years ago.,"Hey, all. Just wanted to update on a thread I made here 5 years ago almost. I posted a new comment to it but I figured more people would see it here, and I'm so excited by how I'm feeling I wanted to share it in a new post. I hope that's okay.

------------
Update almost 5 years later!

I have no doubt that the people who read this last thread don't even remember it, but I wish them well. The words of sympathy, the empathy. Meant a lot at that time.


I'm here in the same exact spot on that lonely country road almost 5 years later, and just about 24 hours ago I gave my 3 weeks notice to my employer, after 21 years. Got a new job lined up, going to take a few days off before I pick it up after my notice. Completely new career path, and I am excited as hell.

Things never did get better at that job, it's been like a pressure cooker for five long years. I would go to sleep terrified every night, when I could sleep, and wake up terrified every morning. Just seeing what horrible texts or emails I got overnight, the people calling off because they were sad (which is legitimate), or the folks with a bellyache (also legitimate), knowing that meant I'd often be there from 5am to 8pm or later. Staffing shortages, then covid, more staffing shortages, pressure from corporate that was always unrealistic, it's all gone now. All gone. And a few short weeks it won't be my circus or my monkeys anymore.

I've just been driving around listening to music and smiling, it's been a goddamn long time. And now I find myself on the same spot on the same country road, and a completely different frame of mind.

This feels fucking triumphant. I have no doubt for the length of my notice period things are going to be super awkward and weird, and sad. I grew up in this job, I love the place, I love the people. At some point I had to make a change to show my love for myself though. I'm taking a pretty steady pay cut, but I'm totally fine with that. Straight 40 hours, holidays off. For so long the only time I really saw my family, for all these years, I was working at home and screaming and ranting and raving about all the bullshit. And now I can begin the healing process.


If you're going through some shit right now, please have courage. It doesn't have to end like this. It really doesn't. Have faith in yourself, and that things can get better.

Maybe this new company I'm moving to is going to be hell on Earth too, but I've made a final decision and drew a line in the sand. I won't accept my whole life being dominated by a business again. I hope if you find yourself in a bad situation that someday you find the strength to change it.

This is an amazing feeling, like I can breathe again. I didn't forget this thread, and I didn't forget the people who responded with empathy, or the subreddit full of people who are hurting.

Thank you, in a weird way I love you.",Horseticuffs,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/q9luky/update_on_a_thread_i_made_almost_5_years_ago/,0

"Just need to vent. Get my thoughts out. About employement/money, personal life/family. Any Advice?","I'm 21 and I've had a lot of jobs in my life so far. I dropped out of highschool at 16 due to depression and thought life would get better if I just started working earlier. I participated in a internship as a chefs apprentice working part time at $10/hr, then it ended and was never offered the job, then started working as a housekeeper for a couple of months for $9/hr, but I didn't want to do that because it was disgusting. Then I had a hiatus before working at a factory that build the infrastructure to small business buildings which was grueling work. Wake up at 3am get home at 7pm and start over the next day for $11/hr. I was 17-18 during this time. Then I started to work at a hotel for 2 years working the night shift for $12/hr until I was robbed by two guys who zipped tied me and threatened my life. So I resigned after like 2-weeks. Then I started working in the parts department at a car dealership delivering and selling car parts. Which was very monotonous and really didn't help with the depression. So after like 2 months I had to quit and admit myself into a psychiatric ward for suicidal thoughts. Which was one of the biggest mistakes of my life as all they tried to do was give me Zoloft and keep me with people in FAR WORSE condition then I was in a locked and isolated part of the hospital. Didn't even get to go outside for fresh air or anything. Then shortly after coming home id say about 6 months go by and I didn't have another job. And then my mom divorced her husband which cause me to no longer have a place to live although my room was in the basement not much of a ideal living situation to begin with. Only on the day of that I had to leave, my cousin said that I could live with him and my Aunt. Now we're in the first half of the Covid pandemic and I'm 20 years old. I received the stimulus and I was fooled into buying my first car which costed me about $4000 but in hindsight isn't even worth $2000. Now I know better. A couple months go by and now it's my birthday I'm turning 21 and I didn't even do anything with none of my family and as I'm laying down to go to bed someone is outside towing my aunt's car away so we run outside to retrieve our items before he pulls away. Mind you like 2 months prior I paid almost $5000 to get her car out of the impound. I did so with gratitude that she lets me live here rent free, but still this is a bummer. I had no money left and so naturally I started working again, this time at a nursing home that my aunt works at. Since I had front desk experience at a hotel I worked reception at the nursing home part time for $10/hr. Then things get a little more stressful for me. My cousin and his gf are having a baby. So in the months leading up to my nephews birth my cousin is pretty much designated driver for everyone as he needs the car in case of an emergency. Eventually the baby is born and the baby mom is kicked out because she's being very problematic and disrespectful to the entire household. She even handles the newborn like she didn't give a fuck. So as my cousin works 12 hours shifts towing, I have to babysit his newborn child from 6am to 3pm until my Aunt comes home and I have to go to work. So back at work I am being transferred to a closer facility to home to help my aunt in the kitchen as a dietary aide getting paid 50¢ less but more hours but still less than full time as I have to watch the baby. I have to take the bus to work as my cousin is using my car. And then it's about 6 months of this until my cousin gets partial custody. Still have to babysit and take the bus to work. Making just enough money to pay my car insurance (for a car I'm not using), phone, credit card, etc. and whatever little money I have left I spend on food, clothes, etc. After about 4 months my cousin buys his own car. A 2014 Audi A4. And gives my my POS car back. Eventually my cousin tells me I can get a job with him doing road side assistance making more than double what I make at the nursing home, so naturally I say yes. Come to find out I was under the impression of making $20+/hr when in reality it's was $13/hr plus mandatory overtime. I was working 72 hours a week for $13 an hour changing 20 tires a day with a fucking tire iron, the company didn't give me shit to work with. The highlight of my day was jumpstarting a car. Now we are in the middle of summer while there is a heat advisory and I'm trying to change a man's tire in front of his house (don't understand how that requires ""roadside assistance"") and it won't budge. I call my boss and he tells me to keep trying and to use some WD40. Still doesn't work and I'm drenched in sweat dying in the heat. Eventually I tell the customer he needs someone with a impact wrench and that I can't do it. I go back to my van and think I suffered a mini heat stroke but don't really think anything of it. I just cool off in the A/C then continue my day. Eventually after working only a month the boss wants me to train another employee which I feel obligated to do. So after about 2 weeks it's obvious this man Is a bad driver and I notify the boss about it but he turns a blind eye to it. Not even a week later said employee crashes the van I use to do my job. So the boss moves me over to a 26 thousand pound truck that I'm not comfortable driving so I had to decline and miss work until he got a new van but after some time off I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to work for this company anymore, they don't pay you on time, they constantly lie to the customers about how far away I am, and they don't care about their employees not one ounce.  
So now I'm unemployed and my life is starting to get to my mental. My Aunt and I take care of my cousins child more than he does and most of his money goes towards his Audi he sometimes misses payments on and Weed that I don't even smoke anymore because I get headaches now. Now it's the present day and I'm still unemployed still babysit while my cousin has another child on the way with a different woman who isn't any better in the sense of raising a child. She literally yells at her own 4 year old daughter calling her names like stupid, annoying, and screams at her to leave her alone. Besides that. I'm going back to working at the nursing home pretty soon but this time as a cook. But I feel like a marionette. A puppet being controlled by strings. I can't help but to feel like it's almost impossible to pursue my interests because of my financial and family situation. I don't want to leave my nephew or have my cousin resent me for the way i feel towards him. And he's told me before that I'm not bound here and that I can do whatever I want but how could I?

Feeling hot but no fever...anyone else?.,"So, a lot of the time, it feels like I'm really hot inside and coming down with something so I take my temp and it's only 97.4 or 98.6 or something.

Sometimes the heat feeling is all over, other times it feels like it's in my abdomen or chest or around my head. Kind of like I'm radiating an ""aura"" of heat or like something is ""cooking"" inside me. Very uncomfortable.

I thought it was my GERD but antacids do nothing. I've been under a lot of stress for years and already have GAD/OCD/ADHD/Bipolar.

Sometimes I feel like my whole body is just this glowing hot star in the sky, putting out light/heat.

No emotional resilience?,"Hi guys,

I work in a really rewarding area helping people. However, I’ve noticed that as my workload has increased - I have been unable to switch off after work.

This has caused headaches, anxiety and periods of bad depression.

this one is for the people already stressed out from uni/college,"At the start of a new school/uni/college term, we are hopeful, ambitious, and most importantly - confident that we will be disciplined and focused throughout the year.

Oh, my sweet summer child.

If you’re even a little bit like me after just a few weeks of hustling, the following applies:

⚠️ Your notes are all over the place.

⚠️ Your deadlines are piling up and you are staying up late to get on track.

⚠️ You have started neglecting your own priorities in favor of schoolwork.

All of those can lead to an increase in your stress levels, which will make it even harder to adjust your focus and stay disciplined during the term. And stress can lead to a ton of unhelpful things concerning your health, such as a decreased quality of sleep, slowed-down metabolism, a decrease in the quality of your immune response.

So, we already agree that stress is the enemy and it is most commonly caused by too much work piling up. [In this article](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/zoom-out), I will list 3 ways in which you can zoom out on your life and reconfigure your priorities, essentially restarting your routines and getting you back on track.

it's an underwater experiment. don't you feel like the only time it's silent is when being underwater. yess! so this sound was really helpful to me and others who liked meditating. please give it a try and let me know what you think, and hopefully I'll be making other similar content.

this is not a promotion, I genuinely want to hear your thoughts on this. and I suggest you recommend it to others who might have panic attacks or have trouble sleeping, I find this really calming to detach from unwanted thoughts for a bit. but then again maybe it just does it for me. let me know!!

Mindfulness FINALLY helped me manage my Stress and Overthinking,"I like to think of myself as a fairly productive guy. I have goals for myself and I do what I can to get closer to them. There is a lot of stress and anxiety that is associated with this constant drive. This stress and overthinking can sometimes become debilitating. It was at this point that I started to incorporate more mindfulness practices into my life.

There is a phenomenon known as the Stress Reaction Cycle, where our thoughts and emotions can negatively affect and cause us to react badly. Mindfulness has helped me collect myself and manage this much better than I thought.

I was always a skeptic and questioned how effective meditation and stuff would be for me, but a technique called ‘Dropping In’ and ‘The Mindful Mediated Stress Response’ helped me a whole lot.

I'm not eating properly due to extreme stress and I'm scared I'm starving myself,"(Sorry for poor format, I'm on mobile)

For context- I'm 18/f, and I recently lost my grandfather. This is the first death in the family I ever experienced.
I have diagnosed PTSD, OCD, severe anxiety, major depression, and emetophobia (the fear of vomiting)
I felt like I was getting better for a while, until my grandfather passed away.

I'm constantly worried for my grandmother, who now lives alone, in a house that has no phone service other than the home phone,
I just quit my job and am starting work at another store, and due to my anxiety I'm incredibly stressed about my first day of work.

I'm on new medications which lower my bloodpressure making it harder for me to eat, and, I recently was incredibly sick (vomiting).

I haven't been able to eat very well in about a month now. I cannot eat until I relax enough mentally (which is very hard to do) which usually is only at 8pm at night.

Usually all I eat in one day is maybe one candy bar and a bowl of crackers. That's all I can stomach.
Some days I'm okay and I can eat a healthy sandwich but it's rare now.

I haven't been able to sleep without taking some kind of medication to help me fall asleep, either.

I can't eat big meals due to fear, I can't relax enough to eat, and I'm struggling to deal with low blood sugar due to it.

I'm not sure how to relax, I don't know how to calm down enough to go back to taking care of my basic needs. Any advice or help on how to calm down is greatly appreciated.",CorklesTheBorkles,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/q4dvf4/im_not_eating_properly_due_to_extreme_stress_and/,0

"Need to work significant overtime for the next two months, nausea from stress advice appreciated!","Hey guys! I am self employed and a couple months ago I found out an event I thought was going to be cancelled is happening. I've been working on prepping to sell/present at this event well in advance but I wasn't hitting it as hard as I *could have* because I thought the chance of it happening was low. 

Long story short I'm a couple months out and just straight up burnt out. I haven't had a true vacation since fall 2019 and just the idea of going into my office makes me want to cry. It's to the point that when I think of my workload I feel a wave of nausea, get headaches, light headed, etc. I am stuck and can't get out of this for multiple reasons so I will have to work 6 days a week until the deadline.

Things I'm already doing: 
-using a planner
-listening to things in the background (though thanks to covid I've burned through most tv shows, music, podcasts, etc and not being able to find anything good adds to my irritation)
-taking breaks throughout the day and at night 

Other info:
-can't move my work elsewhere. I use a lot of different supplies and equipment that are unmovable 
-i literally don't have time for a vacation but I do try and take a mini afternoon break once a week 
-I have normal household things to do on top of this and I about had a meltdown coming home to take care of a bunch of housework (I feel silly even saying this but yeah)

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to keep myself from getting so worked up that I'm sick. I know it's absolutely irrational to dwell on what I need to do and this is WAY more cush a job than working overtime somewhere like a hospital.  I just feel like I'm about to lose my mind and I need some advice.

Breaking down.,"Right now I am having a lot of stress going on in my life. It feels like it’s not going to stop anywhere soon. I am a coach of a sport team. I love my team. I love coaching, right now some stuff coming out are drama/toxic stuff within the team. Today I talked with all my players about what’s going on with them personally, anything on their chests. All this stuff is coming out. I am feeling overwhelmed about it. I don’t show my team my stressed out from this information I am receiving. I just want the best for them.

Next, my parents. So I live with my parents and i’m a 30 year old woman. I feel like I shouldn’t be living with my parents. I don’t want to live with them. But I’m living with them because I got out of an abusive relationship awhile back. I’m trying to build myself back up again. I told my parents about it a little bit they don’t show the support I need from them right now. I know they love/care for me, but that emotional support isn’t there. Like for instance today. Since I got done talking with my team about what has been going on. I came home. Wanted to relax. My mom especially just so oblivious to what’s going on with me. She starts telling me, “well… maybe you should just quit. There are other people that can coach. You don’t NEED to do it.” I’m just really bought down by her words. 

Tonight I am support to work my 2nd job at midnight. I just don’t have any motivation to go to work. The conversation I just had with my mother is really bothering me. Inside I feel like I really wanted to snap back at her and just yell back at her. But I know if I do that. It’s not going to make things right… it’ll make it worse. On top of that, my sister and niece live with us too. My sister told our family I from the beginning she doesn’t want her daughter to see us arguing. So I’m over here getting really frustrated because I don’t want my niece to see me yelling and arguing with my mother.

Another thing is if I did try to bring this up to my mother. She’ll get upset that I’m bringing up how I don’t get any emotional support from her and she’ll just start gaslighting me on other stuff. Her attitude is very controlling. It’s her way or the Highway. I’m embarrassed that she still tries to control our lives even me being the oldest at 30. 

I seriously don’t want to live here. I love my parents but I feel like I can’t have an adult relationship with my parents to express some concern the way they handle things. So I just tend to not say anything and keep stuff inside. I know that’s not healthy. I just don’t want to argue with anyone. At the same time, I’m getting really tired of it.

I don’t know if this post will get anywhere. I just needed to write about this. Something. I’m considering moving out, moving away from my hometown. But I’m sad if I do, this will be the end of my coaching career and makes me feel like I’m quitting. I want to go back to school too. Just right now everything is just so stressful and it’s hard to think straight.",captianlights3,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/q2c91g/breaking_down/,1

L-theanine for Sleep and Stress – What Does Science Say?,"The nonprotein water-soluble amino acid (AA), L-theanine (γ-Glutamylethylamide), is found in Camellia sinensis (green tea) leaves. It’s actually the main component of green tea. In fact, it’s considered green tea’s most ample form of total AAs (around 50%).

It was identified in 1948 in Japan as a green tea constituent, and while it’s found mostly in the tea plant, it’s present in a few other plants, such as mushrooms like Boletus badius.

l theanine in tea for sleep

Although L-theanine is synthesized in plants’ roots, it concentrates in the leaves. It can impact important brain chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) positively that are involved with sleep, mood, and stress. It seems to play a role in GABA formation. This is a neurotransmitter that works similar to a “brake” during stressful times.

L-theanine helps initiate balance in your neurotransmitter system, leading to improvements in the physical and emotional/mental disturbances that result from being overly stressed.

What Does L-theanine Do in Your Body?
Some ways L-theanine works in your body include:

 1. Promotes a Calmness Feeling
Although L-theanine helps to increase chemicals that calm you down, it can also decrease your brain’s levels of chemicals linked with anxiety and stress.

Your brain begins producing hormones like corticosterone and cortisol when you’re stressed.

l theanine for anxiety2. Neurotransmitter Boost
An adequate dose of L-theanine helps boost your levels of brain chemicals that produce a “calm” feeling, such as serotonin, GABA, and dopamine.

These neurotransmitters assist your brain in regulating:

Mood
Emotions
Concentration
Alertness
Ability to sleep
Therefore, if you increase your levels of calming brain chemicals, it could help you relax and sleep more easily.

3. Nootropic Effects
Taking an L-theanine supplement offers a cognitive enhancing (nootropic) effect. Research shows, taking this amino acid before you take a test helps improve focus and reduce errors.

This calming brain effect might also help keep your mind from wandering when you’re trying to stay on task and recall information.

4. Enhance Alpha Brain Waves
L-theanine is an anxiolytic, and therefore, helps amplify/enhance alpha brain waves. These are also present when you let your mind wander or when you meditate. Alpha waves also occur during REM sleep as your sleeping brain is still in “wakeful relaxation” mode.

L-theanine may help you replicate some of the creativity-oriented effects and focus on your experience during meditation.

Taking a Closer Look at How L-theanine Helps with Sleep, Stress, and Anxiety
L-theanine is most recognized for helping people relax. However, it’s also been shown to help with sleep, stress, and anxiety.

L-theanine for Sleep
Obtaining proper sleep is more than just falling asleep and waking up eight hours later. During sleep, your body is washing your brain with cerebral spinal fluid. This allows your neurons to communicate with one another and eliminates toxins your brain builds up when you’re awake.

l theanine for better sleep

In your brain’s pineal gland, serotonin converts to melatonin. Therefore, when you improve your levels of serotonin, it ultimately leads to improved melatonin levels, supporting restful sleep.

There are several studies that suggest L-theanine might potentially help individuals relax before bedtime, obtain sleep more easily and even experience deeper sleep.

These benefits might come from the certain effects l-theanine has on your brain chemicals that have a role in sleep.

One study in 2018 found that individuals who took 450 mg to 900 mg of L-theanine each day for eight weeks reported experiencing greater sleep satisfaction. The participants in the study were taking antidepressants for generalized anxiety disorder.

In another study, 30 healthy individuals were given either a placebo or 200 mg of L-theanine for four weeks. When compared to those taking the placebo, those taking the L-theanine:

Took less time to fall asleep
Took less sleep medicines
Experienced fewer sleep disturbances
They also experienced enhanced mental clarity, which isn’t a surprise after getting a good night’s sleep.

L-theanine’s alpha brain-boosting abilities could help your body and brain enter the NREM sleep stage (first stage) where your alpha brain waves are at their highest level. L-theanine supplementation could help you fall asleep easier and quicker at bedtime because of its relaxation-boosting abilities. This amino acid doesn’t work as a sedative, but rather promotes relaxation and lowers anxiety levels.

Stress almost took me out,So I don’t want this to be too long I just wanted to get  this out to whoever is in a similar situation. Yesterday I got into a big argument with my SO and I was absolutely furious and just confused by their actions and words. She blames me for almost everything and yesterday I got so stressed out and angry that I was rushed to the hospital! I almost had a heart attack and the medic who showed up to my apartment diagnosed me with svt! Which later was confirmed to be heart palpitations! I’m 31 and it was one of the scariest feelings I’ve ever dealt with. I had to bring my one year old daughter with me bc I had nobody to watch her and just not being able to hold her hand threw that all really affected me. But I wrote this all to say that whatever situation you’re going through try not to let that feeling of emotion take over you. I really let this woman bring me to a level i never reached in my life! I’ve never been to the hospital for anything. No health issues whatsoever! So I can almost guarantee that me letting stress and anger get the best of me almost cost me my life. The medic said that if I was up in age I probably would have died because my heart wouldn’t have been able to sustain a rate of 250! So I just want to say to anyone who reads this to do whatever you can to stay stress free and take care of your health. Don’t let anyone control you to the point that I did.

Bad first day at new job,"Cross posting on r/Anxiety
A bit of background info: I have started a bunch of new things lately, different counselors and just a bunch of new things in general are happening in my life. It has caused me to sleep bad and less and I have just generally been kind of stressed.

Yesterday at had my first day at a new job and within the first half hour of being there I passed out and slammed  my head against a table so I cracked my lip open and threw up. All in front of my new employer. I was supposed to go back today, but my mom called and we agreed I shouldn’t be working there because of how stressful everything is right now, agreeing it isn’t the right time. Anyway, my mom want us to go over there and say thanks for the opportunity and make sure we leave on a good note, which of course is a good idea, I know that, I am just so embarrassed. The fact that she had to see me like that is so embarrassing. And to top it of we kind of know her a little outside of work… ugh, what do I do? I know I shouldn’t be embarrassed but I just can’t help it.",bananamilkgz,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pz14ec/bad_first_day_at_new_job/,0

I can't sit at my desk anymore because of anxiety attacks,It's really hard for me to sit at my desk at home anymore because of how my brain associates it with stress and it's really hindering my academic progress. I had a breakdown at my desk about 3 days ago and 2 weeks prior to that I would have heart palpitations whenever I started doing homework for college. Im a freshman who just started college a month ago and I dropped physics(the course that caused most of my stress) but im still having problems with my mental state. Would it be better to take part time semesters next year to take it as a breather or try and tough it out until I graduate. Im so lost in life right now and I don't know how to fix this problem. I have so many people supporting me but I feel like im going to let them and myself down if I just give up without trying to take a step forward,Recon12803,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/py13hd/i_cant_sit_at_my_desk_anymore_because_of_anxiety/,1

{Repost} [Academic] How do you experience stress in your body? (18-65),"Hi there! I'm looking for survey participants for my grad school thesis project on the prevalence of different stress responses across the population. There are only 2 days left to participate! We are aiming for 1,000 participants and are at 898 so we would love it if anyone here could fill this out!

Our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh is conducting a research study to measure how people experience **stress**. If you are a US citizen or resident between the ages of 18-65 years old, you are eligible to participate! The study involves filling out some questionnaires about how stress manifests itself in your body. Depending on your unique stress response, the survey could take as little as 5 minutes or up to approximately 15 minutes to complete. To compensate you for completing the survey, **you can choose to have your name entered for the opportunity to receive an iPad**. You may also elect to do the survey as a volunteer without compensation (i.e., without having your name entered to receive an iPad).

Some respondents may be invited to fill out the survey a second time at a later date and will again have the opportunity to receive compensation.

Getting real tired of this damn life,"No this ain't no serious harm upon myself but I am just stressing tf out right now. I have so much shit on my plate and it's getting hard to handle. 

First let me start off with my vision. I'm getting more blind by the day, making life very difficult to adjust to. I need surgery to get better but I'm just so fucking broke. 

Second, my wisdom teeth are getting worse. I might end up losing my right molar cause of it, cause I'm not acting on it fast or anytime soon. 

Third, I work at a shit job, breaking my back for 15$ hr. Not worth it. Yes I'm working on getting a better job, I stopped smoking weed a month ago and I'm waiting to get clean. But even then, my vision plays a big role in working at a decent job. 

Fourth, my vehicle needs some maintenance before it gets worse. Again, I need money for all this shit. I hope it's nothing to serious. But with my luck, we will see. 

It seems like I'm just so fucking cursed. I'm getting real stressed out and need someone to talk to. I really wanna see a psychiatrist but again, money money money.

People Have Lost It,"I suppose this shouldn’t be a surprise but I’m so…disappointed in how people are behaving in public. 

I’d like to think my husband and I are, at least for the most part, nice people. We pretty much just mind our own business and leave people alone. We see no point in ruining someone’s day and try to be patient—knowing that people are going through tough things in life, especially now. 

But we have noticed that people are so on edge right now, it’s downright scary. We were driving through a park over the weekend and the lady in front of us just decided to stop her vehicle on the bridge—which isn’t allowed, btw. Ok…we figured she had a reason so we waited for her patiently to wave us by or something. But instead she flipped us off while she was waving us to pass her. She cussed my husband out as we passed her…and he made the mistake of telling her “hey there is a sign you just passed that says no parking. Have a nice day.”

We left the park thinking she was kind of rude…but oh well. We make it out of the park and down the road. And this car comes screaming behind us and my husband was like…”that’s her and she is tailgating our car, screaming, and flipping us of.” 

She had kids in the car and was acting like we did something horrible to her. 

She followed us for miles cutting people off and making sure we saw that middle finger. Finally we got separated at a traffic light. I waved her goodbye—and if I had holy water, I would have tossed it in her direction.

It would be one thing if this was just one person who was clearly having a bad day. But I’m noticing more and more people acting, for lack of better description, evil as fuck.

People need Jesus. That’s what we tell you in the South when you’re so evil you’re almost beyond hope. You need Jesus…that is all.",Cocobham,14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pw6eht/people_have_lost_it/,0

You should read about *what happens* when they are activated and *how* they are activated.

Our Sympathetic nervous system is continuously activated when we have stress (that why we get weird symtoms).

Rant,"Hi idk if this is the place to post but honestly so stressed reflecting on my
Life and where it has taken me thus far.
I try my very best to live a happy life but it honestly just isn’t working. My relationship with my mother is really bad. She doesn’t even talk to me like she use to. I feel like I just burden her by existing. I’m stressed out with work and school. I work a million hours while studying a million more and it just never ends. My best friend doesn’t really seem like my best friend anymore. I have been dealing with consistent death and cancer within my family. My beloved grandfather was just diagnosed with cancer, both of my grandparents on the other side of my family died a couple years ago and I spent so much time with them growing up and to see them gone broke my heart. I isolated myself after their death and all of my friends graduated highschool and I was bullied relentlessly in my senior year. It was a few years ago but still. Idk.  I was sexually assaulted last year and it really fucked up my last relationship. Like I don’t even really want to have sex anymore Like I use to. We broke up and I sincerely loved this girl with all my heart, a piece of me left when she did. We broke up in December but we were together for a year and it’s just been so weird in my dating life, until recently I’ve been able to start talking to girls again but I made a lot of mistakes and dated someone who was so abusive and who cheated on me and all of this other shit. I never see my dad and things are just so weird now. 

I just want to find a cloud and float away. I don’t want to think about work, or student loans, or any of that. I just want to be in a meadow with bumblebees and flowers or on a mountain hundreds of miles away where none of this can touch me. I want my own family I want people who love me I want to live this dream I feel like I’m building but some days it feels like all of this building is getting me nowhere. The only thing that keeps me going anymore is that thought of just one day finding true love and having genuine friends in my life.

Laptop trackpads to detect stress?,"8 in 10 people report being stressed weekly, and 73% say that stress affects their mental health.

Results from the study by Stanford University researchers show that as little as 4 clicks on a trackpad can be used to detect the presence of acute stress in individuals, helping to track it early and begin treatment.

It's a weird thing that has been happening to me every time I am a little stressed during the day, maybe not even consciously realizing that I am stressed. So when I go to bed and I'm about to fall asleep I need to quickly sit up and I'm gasping for air. It happens 1-second passes and I'm alright.

Then it happens 7-8 times, and it really affects my sleep. A few seconds before I fall asleep I feel this shock/panic but each time I sit up it disappears. However, on the weekend, I'm sleeping like a baby without issues when I am not stressed.

How I manage stress as a student - the Zoom-out process,"At the start of a new school/uni/college term, we are hopeful, ambitious, and most importantly - confident that we will be disciplined and focused throughout the year.

Oh, my sweet summer child.

If you’re even a little bit like me after just a few weeks of hustling, the following applies:

⚠️ Your notes are all over the place.

⚠️ Your deadlines are piling up and you are staying up late to get on track.

⚠️ You have started neglecting your own priorities in favor of schoolwork.

All of those can lead to an increase in your stress levels, which will make it even harder to adjust your focus and stay disciplined during the term. And stress can lead to a ton of unhelpful things concerning your health, such as a decreased quality of sleep, slowed-down metabolism, a decrease in the quality of your immune response.

So, we already agree that stress is the enemy and it is most commonly caused by too much work piling up. [In this article](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/zoom-out), I will list 3 ways in which you can zoom out on your life and reconfigure your priorities, essentially restarting your routines and getting you back on track.

You can think of it as the **Zoom-out process** or the “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” approach.",kofiscrib,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pteeab/how_i_manage_stress_as_a_student_the_zoomout/,0

Same thing during the next internship. Then the stress was about being unemployed after college. Finally while working, I'm also applying to master's programs. All this time I've been masturbating 3-4 times a day to cope with it. It leaves me weak throughout the day. I've also been unmotivated for months now.

The mask,"No, not the n95. I’m talking about the mask I wear every day to appear functioning. You know how you see pictures of people who were depressed and they are all smiling. Then the caption reads “ this is what depression looks like.” I get it. I get up in the morning and feel like I have to get through another day but I do it.  I go to work. I smile and laugh with co workers or customers. I make small talk. I put on my manager mask and delegate work and explain that it’s important or have passion in my voice. I lead meetings and inspire my team to “ kill it out there”. Own it! Go team! I cheerlead. Then I turn it off and go back to being me.  FYI my problem is anxiety not depression or at least I think so.  I do the same with family, friends, etc. it’s exhausting. When ppl come over I can’t wait for them to leave so I can stop acting.  The first time I got a job as a teen, my mom saw how terrified I was to apply. She said “fake it. Go in there like someone who would really be a go getter” and I did.  It worked.

I told my mom off on the week of her breast cancer surgery and can’t get past it,"Pretty much what the title says. I’ve been sleeping poorly for the last week or so due to stress. Yesterday I was incredibly tired, I could hardly focus on my work. I was sitting in my cubicle and saw my mom sent the family an email about covid from the Blaze, a garbage conservative news outlet. I read the article about how monoclonal antibodies need to be approved for treatment, etc etc. It was such a poorly written article and so obviously propaganda that I started to type an email response to the whole family stating why this article was garbage and pleading with my mom to stop reading that crap. My wording was harsh in some spots and it came off as condescending I’m sure, since I simply had zero filter because I was exhausted. 

My sister immediately replied asking why would you choose this week of all weeks to bring this up when she sends these articles all the time, and I immediately knew I’d fucked up. My dad later sent me a similar email. I sent an apology email and said I was only mad at the news outlet, not my mom, and I don’t want it to be construed any other way. I apologized to my sister and dad and personally to my mom. They all forgave me and said it seemed uncharacteristic of me, but I can’t shake it that it even came out of me, a few days before her cancer surgery. This is only compounding onto the stress that caused this blowup in the first place.

Pressure headaches / weakness in legs,"Hi everyone,

The past 4 weeks I’ve been very stressed. I’ve personally been putting it down to the 2 does of the C-19 vaccine I’ve had, and thought my symptoms may have been an adverse reaction as others are having similar.

However the more I think about it, I am constantly stressing about it, there’s not a second in the day my forehead feels like it’s under pressure and I struggle to think straight. I’ve had pins and needles that has spread around my body too and in the past few days my appetite has been off alongside my legs feeling very weak to walk on. I’ve began to think this may just be down to health anxiety, and I’m posting to see if anyone’s ever suffered similar for similar durations of time? And if so, how have you helped combat this?

I also go abroad for a week tomorrow, and I’m quite a nervous flyer too. I’m a usually a fit, healthy 24 yo M but the past few weeks I’ve never cried so much with worry and stress about myself. It takes a lot to post about this so please be mindful.

Please note this isn’t an anti-vax post nor do I need comments about the vaccine, I’ve taken 2x doses and the purpose of my post is to see if people have suffered from similar to what I’m going through. Any help would be massively appreciated if anyone has had the same as me.",mcky250,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pms44z/pressure_headaches_weakness_in_legs/,0
METHODS AND PRINCIPLES OF OVERCOMING STRESS,"
We each have our own level of stress, which is determined by hereditary and other factors, and our level of attitude and response to stress.


 
Different people respond to stress in different ways: some begin to absorb unthinkable amounts of food, others completely lose their appetite; some have difficulty falling asleep at night, while others feel sleepy even during the day.


 
The basic principles of coping with stress include:


 
Distraction from a stressful situation
 if what is happening makes a strong impression on a person and after that he continues to think about it, then thereby he “gets stuck” in a stressful situation and does not think about how to resolve it, but constantly worries about the events that have occurred . To distract yourself from a stressful situation, you need to think about something else related to pleasant sensations and experiences (rest, pleasant event, personal achievements).
Reducing the subjective significance of the event that caused stress – to reconsider your attitude to what happened according to the principle: “What is not done is for the better …”.
Active behavior – not to keep in yourself the surging feelings and emotions that caused stress, but to throw out the accumulated energy outward by doing some even unthinkable business (for example, washing the window or floor with a toothbrush, wiping clean dishes, etc.); as well as playing sports, playing football, volleyball, etc.
Relaxation – Stress causes general tension and an increase in the frequency of brain waves. Relaxation, on the other hand, reduces their frequency, which leads to a decrease in the level of excitation of the central nervous system.
Positive thinking – a positive way of thinking and the associated positive emotions of kindness, love, joy – is the main personal tool for ensuring health and well-being.
Other ways to relieve stress and maintain mental health include the following:


 
In any situation, one should remain optimistic.
Strive for reasonable organization in life, work, everyday life.
Learn to say no to yourself, not to take on the solution of too many problems, especially those of others, by defining the boundaries of your own capabilities.
Learn to enjoy life.
Don’t be a maximalist.
Do not delve into your past and, moreover, do not regret what you did not do or did wrong.
Observe the correct diet, sleep and rest.
Do not abuse alcohol, refrain from bad habits.
Lead a healthy active lifestyle , engaging in daily physical exercises and self-massage of the head, neck, shoulders, and feet.
If necessary – a decrease in the pace of life and a revision of some life positions.

I recently quit my toxic job without a backup plan,"I’ve gotten quite a lot of negative comments from people about how stupid it was for me to do that. But let me explain…..

I’ve worked with this company for over 2 years and believe it or not, I was considered a “tenure” employee. Throughout my time there, I saw people come and go with my longest coworker being there for only a year. The turnover was so high, I began to question the reason why I was there and realized I was trapped. I put my blood, sweat, and tears into projects that were never recognized, I picked up tasks that weren’t a part of my job description because there were always newer employees who didn’t know how to do them and never stayed long enough to learn how. If it didn’t get done then I couldn’t perform my own tasks so it was a pretty messed up situation. I also worked through the pandemic, putting myself at risk coming into the office after they said we couldn’t WFH anymore.

I had so much hope that they would recognize my efforts especially after 60+ hours a week. I thought maybe I would get a promotion or a raise for staying loyal to this company. Instead, they gave me a 2% raise and called it a day. Then turned around and offered newer employees higher salaries. 

This place nearly destroyed me. I didn’t sleep at all, my self esteem was broken, I developed a serious drinking problem because I had no escape, I was ruining my relationships because of how miserable I was, and I couldn’t take vacations because I was so afraid of coming back to a pile of work that would take me months to catch up on. 

Sure, you could say “oh that’s normal in the corporate world.” Or “you should’ve looked for another job while you were working.” You know what….no! I did try looking for jobs, but I couldn’t find time in the day to attend interviews. Also, the last thing I wanted to do was apply for jobs after a 12 hour work day. I saved my free time for rest and the little relaxation I could get.

My psychiatrist even told me that she could see me slowly killing myself. If it wasn’t going to be suicide, it would be because of stress.

So yeah, I left.

Since then, I’ve been criticized for making this “stupid decision”. And I’ll admit, I’m broke as hell…..but at least I’m smiling again. If being stupid means choosing to care for myself over selling my soul to the corporate world, then send me back to preschool because at least I can fingerprint in peace ✌🏻",shelbzisthename,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pmgyjx/i_recently_quit_my_toxic_job_without_a_backup_plan/,0

too much,"Where to start.

I have a management job where I'm stuck between a difficult senior manager and a belligerent team. My boss seems to hate my staff (not me just my staff) and they hate her and they all try to get each other by attacking me. This has been on-going for 5 years +. Return to work during covid doesn't help. Ppl are afraid, rude, nasty and looking for reasons to attack each other.

My wife is pregnant - we've had scares for genetic abnormalities - came through all clear. heart abnormalities - came through all clear. Kidney function - came through all clear. Size - came through all clear. All these worries were caused by medics not us. Not one of these concerns ever came from us.

Now in the last few days my wife starts to have itchy hands and she's convinced his has a rare liver condition that could kill the baby.

We were planning to renovate a room for our new baby but the builders have upped the price beyond what we can afford. So I'm DIYing it in my spare time.

And last week I get a call from my optician sending me to an eye hospital with what I ***might*** be an optic nerve problem that could be anything from glaucoma to a brain tumour to nothing at all.

I'm not sleeping, eating too much sugar and drinking too much caffeine. I can't focus. I feel like rebelling, running away, hiding. I feel like I'm a burden on my wife rather than a help. I feel flat and useless.",zedatkinszed,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pm8rok/too_much/,0

Relaxing doesn't help...at all,"I stress about anything and everything, and I have physical symptoms such as increased earwax and even periods while on a birth control where I had no periods. There are others but I can't remember them. But my stress piles and piles on me, some of which even my therapist agrees I can't do anything about because the reasons are unavoidable. If the cause is fixed it goes away, but you can't get rid of all stressors....I've tried.

I do know how to relax, I even have mental health days where I focus on having fun and I don't do anything else.

But relaxing, having fun, taking care of myself mentally and such don't actually reduce stress for me. My therapist seemed genuinely surprised and a bit confused, but couldn't offer much help. They are helping me in other ways so I don't want to try to find someone else.

Anyone else have this problem or have suggestions? I plan to try yoga but I have physical issues and have a hard time keeping something going more than a couple months when it comes to exercise anyways.

Is there anything besides fun to relax? I can reduce my anxiety, I've been working on my depression and it's bad habits. I just can't think of what else to do, as far as I know there really isn't anything. Fun and relaxation are supposed to reduce stress, and it doesn't. Am I just screwed?

I need help for my Gf for College and stress please,"We just started College and had our first impression with tests (it was about math). Last year we had a Math teacher which wasn’t that good. My Gf would learn for weeks but still not manage to do well on the tests. It would often end with some crying and her saying she’s bad at math. The issue is that she nows doesn’t trust herself with math even though she is completely able to understand and do well in math, when she’s not stressed or it’s just practice.

So coming back to today. At the last period of school we had our first test in college. It was about Factorizing and simplifying some numbers. The teacher gave us 15 min for 9-ish tasks which esch took 5 to 6 steps to solve. So we didn’t have enough time. He gave us 5 min but that didn’t help much. At the end of the test she told me that she had remembered last year and started to panic. Before the test I tried to make her separate this year from last as we had a completely different teacher/school so that she wouldn’t compare her two experiences with one another so that she wouldn’t stress so much. I didn’t work because she once again broke down in tears. I tried to comfort her and make her view it from a different perspective. 

Now you guys come in. I tried everything that I can manage but I’m just not able to help her as I want. I tried a lot but it just feels like that it was engraved in her brain that she’s bad at math. Can you guys please help me to try and help her? I will show her this post once I found a solution so she can answer some questions herself.

Im always stressed. My summer break just ended but I never felt relaxed.,"I have so many things to worry about. I am so busy. I never truly have free time.

1. improving my social skills
2. improving my eating habits
3. trying to get dates which seems impossible
4. im stressed about university which is starting soon and probably gonna give me alot of studying and homework
5. im a long sleeper so I only have about 12 hours per day that im awake to do stuff.
6. i lost friends recently and im trying to get them back
7. preventing my friends from suicide
8. Whenever I play games in attempt to relax my mind, even that exhausts me. Thats how low my energy is.
9. Dealing with people who annoy the shit out of me online

I have so many things to do. It has been like this for years. And even IF I force myself to take a break and relax, I can still not really relax because while I rest there is always a voice in my head telling me that im wasting time by resting and that Ill never get my stuff done.

But having so many things to deal with is not the only problem. I also have no energy because my health is bad and because I'm in depression.

Stress: 100% energy: 0% but I feel guilty while resting.

"Released ""Pausitive"", my own take at a relaxing companion app","Hi everyone,

Having developed chronic anxiety for many years, I've made my own journey to try to fix it: videos, books, meditation, apps, etc. I found many solutions in it, but didn't feel that they were totally tailored to me:

* I gathered a lot of usefull advices, but as I absorbed into my daily routine I failed to put them into practice
* I like to meditate from time to time, but the benefits usually wear off 2 minutes after I stop
* Many advices encourage you to step out of your toxic routine, but you don't necessarilly have the choice on everything, needing to have a work and such

As I absorbed those experiences, my issues felt like some bad habits that I had accumulated over the years, like never putting my mind to rest over the day, or lacking positive thoughts. And so I struggled at finding back how to be at peace again.

That's why, since I'm working as a developer, I've taken a shot to address my own needs by creating a customized app.

That's how I came with ""[Pausitive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinyforest.pausitive)"": it aims to engage you in a pro-active approach and create some training ground with:

* regular reminders to take some break during the day
* enforcing the relaxing advices to create back a positive and relaxing mindset
* panic-mode breathing tool based on cardiac coherence
* soothing background ambiances for work

It has helped me a lot to change my mindset. To be honest, I can't tell that my issues have totally disappeared, since they have been anchored for a very long time, but now I'm more easily aware of them, and having used the app for weeks I feel like I improved my control over my body and mindset.

Since each person's issues are specific, it allows for customizable tips that will only matter to you.

So if you're interested to give it a try, [Pausitive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinyforest.pausitive) is available totally free on Android, and will stay as such (except an option to buy me some coffee if you ever find it useful in the future ).

It does not pretend to be a perfect tool, but I hope it could bring help to others. And I'd be happy to get feedbacks about how to improve it if you got ones.

Take care.",Tiny-Forest,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/piyww7/released_pausitive_my_own_take_at_a_relaxing/,0

Ball-anti-stress or inner peace,"


Everyone has different ways of dealing with internal irritation and external problems: for some, it’s shouting and hurtful words, others prefer to drag on a cigarette in a secluded corner, others choose a well-trodden path to the refrigerator with goodies, seizing bad emotions. All these actions can be described as bad habits. At the same time, there is a simple and effective solution – an anti-stress ball, which helps here and now in each individual situation.

Features of the effect on the nervous system

By squeezing and unclenching the anti-stress ball, you not only train the muscles of the palm and wrists, but also strain the entire arm. The instructions are simple: squeeze the toy for one or two seconds, and then release. You can throw it against the floor and walls. At the same time, muscle tension in the arm decreases, and the clamps in the entire body relax along the chain. Anti-stress ball is an easy way to get rid of negative emotions for both adults and children (from three years old). Bright drawings and pleasant textures are also uplifting.

Additional benefits
A pliable ball strengthens the arm muscles, develops children’s writing skills, relieves tension after long writing tasks, as well as during prolonged work at the keyboard, which is indispensable for tunnel syndrome.


 
 


 
It helps to catch objects more quickly with your hands and hold them firmly, which is important for developing muscle accuracy in children. You will be surprised how the anti-stress ball improves your concentration and takes it to a whole new level


 
 


 
The toy will become an indispensable gift for the holidays, for example, in the shape of a heart – for Valentine’s Day, Christmas trees or stars – for the New Year, a glow – in-the-dark ball with an original smiley face-for Halloween. Such a gift will be appropriate for the development of fine motor skills and attention in a child. You can use it to decorate the interior or use it for trainings and outdoor games in a team. Bright colors and textures are also uplifting.

Life in a pandemic (stress),"
It’s easy to give up and convince yourself that you’re doing the right thing during a global pandemic. However, J. R. R. TolkienMayer believes that it is much more difficult not to fall victim to at least one of the factors of the COVID-19 crisis, whether it is irritation about the inability to lead a normal lifestyle, anxiety about the place of work or a real fear of catching the coronavirus. “First of all, a person’s defense mechanism of denial is triggered,” says Mayer. – And if you feel that the stressors are out there, far beyond your own life, it means that this mechanism of psychological protection is already involved. You can continue to live under the anesthesia of denial until you or someone close to you is affected by the immediate consequences of the pandemic, but the stress remains with you all the time.”

I am having stress hives just about every other day.,"I have a ton of stress. So to start things off I have a brain tumor that is inoperable and pressing on my optic chiasm (where the two eye nerves cross). I am partially blind because of this and have lived like this for the past 4-5 years. Recently the hives started popping up in late April and got so bad that I had to go to Urgent Care and get a prescription for steroid pills and some non itch pills. These did work but I still get a flare up every other day or so as of a month ago. Like I said I have a lot to stress about. I recently lost two pets that I have had for 11 or so years. This year has just been so stressful for me like I just developed a lazy eye in my left eye and like I am just sick and tired of these hives popping up : | To stack everything on top of that, I am starting my senior year of college, so right now is very stressful as you can imagine.

Have to Cope with Past Stress from work and my union,"Hi and thanks for letting me post this here.

I was a trainer at my work but I had to give it up a year ago due to extreme stress. Management would push me to make certain time restrictions when I was training and they hired several people who were unable to do the job. They hired several people who weren't vetted and who didn't take the exam we used to use to weed out people unfit for the position.

For over two years, I trained people who refused to walk (the job is walking all day), a man who had a mental disability (seriously, no hate on stroke survivors -- I seriously commend this dude for trying his best -- I went out of my way for a month helping him do the job -- to my own stressed out determent -- working and helping him off the clock -- but he couldn't work outside in the sun and the heat was getting to him -- our job is outside in all weather -- so basically I was doing my job and then his job. It wasn't fair to me at all, for him to get paid -- and he also sexually harassed me -- I just put up with it and was kind -- I gave him a stern warning more than once, but I didn't report him because I pitied him and his condition.) --- My God, that broke me.

What else happened? We aren't allowed to drive a vehicle with broken turn signals or broken anything really -- the only vehicles they gave us for my trainee to drive had broken turn signals. According to the union and procedure, I can't have her drive in that to learn the job. The bosses said the vehicle guys fixed them. We waited, got the truck back, they weren't fixed. Mgt didn't know what to do. They wanted me to train her anyway and have her drive that truck. It's against policy. No accident happened, thank goodness, but if it had, I would have been fired. Also that vehicle had no gas. We barely made it to two gas stations. The gas card on that vehicle was broken somehow. I had to put my own money in so that woman could get trained. Then I had to wait 30 minutes while clocked out after work to get refunded for using my own money. 

After getting gas in her truck we could finally start training. Then mgt was acting like I was taking too long training her. Really? I mean really? None of that was my fault! The company is supposed to 1. have mgt destroy non-functioning gas cards, 2. have the vehicles in complete working order, not let the mechanics get away with not fixing them, 3. not pressure the trainer for time when they have a trainee trying to learn the job. Oh and they are also supposed to only hire qualified people for the job. Like, I always wanted to be a coder and I didn't go to school for it because my mother convinced me I wasn't smart enough -- fine -- whatever -- but if I got hired as a programmer, with no knowledge, experience, or capability -- that's what it would be like -- so often I've been called ableist for being upset at having to train people who aren't qualified, just to see them blame me for the fact they get fired or quit. We have disabled people. I have an autoimmune disease. It's HARD to do this job with that. You can't call me ableist if I'm talking about qualifications and if I work with very capable people with disabilities on a regular basis. The disabled coworkers I have never call me that. It's always people who have no idea what it means to have to work or be homeless again.

Anyway, back to the stress I'm holding.

For the gas, at least I got refunded. I had to pay $20 to be finger printed when I was hired on as a full time employee (even though I was finger printed before this to be hired at all) and I turned in my receipt and they never refunded me. The union did nothing.

I had a stalker for three years and I almost got fired because of her. All while trying to train people in an inefficient, impossible environment. My stalker was a vulnerable or covert narcissist and she would attack me, follow me around, cuss me our, threaten me, violate the restraining order I had on her, and go to my bosses and make up lies about me.

I have revolving bosses, all headed by a woman who is not qualified for her position and she makes a huge mess -- that boss believed my stalker despite my restraining order. Oh, and the union did nothing. The union doesn't help me even though I pay dues and I contribute a large amount of my checks to the political fund. Still not good enough for them.

I took my stalker to court (good thing I had so much evidence of her stalking me and me doing nothing to her) and I won the restraining order -- then she violated it 7 times -- I took that to the police and they condensed 7 violations into one charge (this is FL, they don't really police things here), and finally she was arrested. She was then sent to jail and then a home for the mentally incompetent. 

I still have my job because I did nothing wrong. All I did was my job and I'm still dealing with the aftermath -- I'm still hearing things she told people about me -- still complete lies -- lies people probably believe -- but who cares? I have a job -- a very difficult job -- but it pays well and I can actually thrive here. I'm not doing what I wanted to do, but it's okay. I'm qualified to be a trainer because I trained most of my other positions. I trained about 100 people and many quit from the stress or disorganized environment -- I did my best. I created a 36 page training packet with help and a cheat sheet on how to do the job and follow all the rules -- the training they get is bad and poorly written, so I made something better. Did I get paid or recognition for that? No!


Omg. I forgot about the woman they hired who yelled in my face. She argued with me on how to do the job. I kid you not. She had no experience, but decided she knew better than someone with 7 years in (at the time) anyway. As if her 1 day on the job made her know better than everyone else? Oh hail naw. She was just a crazy jerk and I was stuck with her abuse and harassment all day.

I said to her ""why are you arguing with me? I'm just showing you how to do this"" and she went off like a crazed woman for 45 minutes abusing and harassing me.

She got fired because she cussed out a supervisor. She was about 50 years old. She was old enough to know how to deal with people.

But like, why did she get to keep her job after abusing me for 3 days of OJT? That's ridiculous. I reported the harassment, turned in statements, and asked for mitigation. Nothing came of it.

But she pulled that shit on someone with 27 years in and who had power? No, she was fired. It's against policy to treat anyone like that.

I also trained a man who tried to train me on the job. I explained to him how it was done and why -- and he just didn't listen and did his own thing. I showed him our official rule book. Nope, he spent 3 days trying to convince me his way was better -- I explained I didn't make the rules, I was just best showing him how to easily follow them and make good decisions.

The union steward turned this story about me training him into a story about a man in our office going through that, as if the man was the one who trained him. The union steward constantly belittles me and doesn't represent me properly. The union steward is threatened because I've been there longer and have lady parts. It's ridiculous. I have helped him for years and backed him for years. I helped him get elected in the first place when he wanted it. When he violated rules, rules that could gave gotten him reprimanded and fired, I gave him a heads up (instead of running towards management to tattle on him -- which someone else did later) -- and he didn't believe me. Then he got reprimanded and completely forgot I gently and kindly tried to help him. Because of his insecurity and issues, and because of other people stressing me out, I have this reputation that I don't know what I'm talking about when I do! I've been there longer than most of them at this point and except for the lies of my stalker and these trainees who were either not qualified or they just didn't try, I have a near perfect record. 

I also never got my 2020 perfect attendance award and no one stood and clapped for my 2019 perfect attendance award. I also never got my 500 hour sick leave recognition pin. Nor did I get paid for much of the training I did. 

Also, I ran a fundraiser and I felt ashamed I only had 2 people contribute (it was non political and allowed) -- but I was so grateful those two did contribute!! 

So yeah, I'm letting all this stress go. I posted it here, because I don't want it in my body or brain anymore. Being stressed about this -- oh and the two coworkers spreading lies about me around the station -- like all that? It's nothing. The only thing that was my fault was caring. I really cared that everyone gets a chance to have the best training possible so they can do the job to the best of their ability. I helped get the man with the stroke into a position he could do, so he's still employed. I tried to help people who got fired find other work. I did what I could. I helped. I took on a bad, disorganized environment and I tried to make it work despite having everything stacked against me. I have better defended myself than the union ever could, when needed. I have lived through threats, harassment, a general sense of discomfort that is daily, and I go to work even if I feel extremely unwell from my disease. I tough it out.

So, Fffffffff this stress! I'm not carrying it! Also F my job for making me quit training and treating the new male trainer like he's gold and only making him train one or two people this year, while I trained for the whole city! Ffffff all them for making me be hurt, physically and emotionally. Ffff my stalker and ffff the lazy police who took their time in helping me/doing their job. 

Thanks for letting me vent this here. I'm done with the stress. I don't care what anyone says about me and I really don't care if I get fired.

Also, f both my parents for calling me lazy all the time. They're both clearly incorrect",CommunicatesPoorly,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/piev4w/have_to_cope_with_past_stress_from_work_and_my/,1
I've Reached My Limit,"I'm just putting this in here to clear my head, I don't expect anyone to respond or react I need to do this for myself. I'm a 21M transfer student who just returned to college 4 days ago. Before I came back to college, I had settled down at home with my mom through the pandemic with a cozy life of video games, Kwik Trip gas station cooking and cashier work, and relaxing alone at home with a healthy variety of time wasters. 

Fast forward to August 2021 and I was coming up upon heading to university to bring more value to my life as being a career gas station clerk wasn't something I was interested doing. The days following my move away from home are overwhelmingly stressful. Although I still live as boring and comfortable as I had been for that time, I can't shake the feeling that I'm losing everything that I had grown to be comfortable with, but most importantly I was losing the physical support of my mother who's also easily my rock that I can rely on. 

Finally, after days of unrest and stress, I move 3 hours away from home- 2 1/2 hours further away than my previous university. The first night was filled with tears and all I could do to calm myself down was call my mom and talk it out but she's not here and I'm not there. Everything's changed now and there's no going back.

I now live in a leased house about 1 mile from campus with 3 roommates (2 I barely know) with everything that I own packed into my small 16 x 14 room. I have to get my car insurance set up on my own now, I have to join student orgs to make connections as well as gain experience and a social life, the house we have hasn't been renovated since the 80s (previous tenants were also weed smokers who must have been a bit aggressive since there's holes in our wood paneled walls), and I'm not sure if my roommates like me or if I need to give them more space (I'm trying to be more social but I don't know if I may come off as obnoxious to them).

Everything is absolutely insane right now. In a way I love the chaos but I'm exhausted everyday I wake up. I can't rest. Nothing I do makes me feel less stressed. I want to put space between me and my roommates but what if I become a stranger to them? I need time alone but I feel I can't be when the roommates are around otherwise I'm the awkward guy out. I'm running out of energy to converse and make friends with strangers.... Everything has changed.

I just wish I could feel relaxed and like I have a place here.

TLDR: 21M has moved from home in hopes of a more meaningful life. Every facet of life has been changed and constant work has worn him down. Nothing relaxes me now.

Need someone to talk too extremely stressed,"I’m honestly not sure where to begin but I’ll try not to make this too long. I’m not sure what’s going on but I’ve been feeling off for the past few days but stressed for longer. I have a full time job but I’m basically working from paycheck to paycheck. I have no other sources of income or help so I’m always stressed about money. Then my health anxiety has me stressed to the max thinking I have a life threatening illness which caused me to quit alcohol 26 days ago. For the past few days I’ve been worried about my child starting high school and hating it there. Will I have to relocate to a new area so she can go to a new school? Is she being bullied ALREADY?!?! Will something happen when I’m at work 10 miles away and can’t get to her because I take public transportation? All of this is going on in my head. 

Then I’m worried because I drank so heavily for so many years that I may have stomach or colon cancer. I haven’t seen a doctor since 2018. I’m always brushed off by them or laughed at. Yes LAUGHED AT as if my feelings and symptoms aren’t valid and real. Been dealing with constipation for a couple weeks now so I’m worried about that. Then my heart rate has been high for the past 4 days. I can’t get it to come down unless I really focus on something else which doesn’t last long. The lowest it got today is 83. Now it’s back up to 97-98. I keep googling and getting on here. I’m not in pain but I feel like I’m losing my mind. I need help to manage this stress.

"Becoming aware of what you're attached to can free you from fear, anger and sadness","In the Buddhist tradition, attachments can be things we desire - that might be money or a relationship or a house in the country. Because we grasp for things that are outside of our current experience, we’re not spending time in the present moment, enjoying the world in front of us. When we don’t get those things we suffer as a result.

Similarly, when we cling to the things that we already have like our career then we set ourselves up for suffering because, of course, everything changes. Attachment in this context is our unwillingness to accept the reality of impermanence.

So we need to cultivate an attitude of non-attachment (or non-striving as Jon Kabat Zinn puts it) to free us from our suffering. Non attachment doesn't mean that that we don’t own things, it means that things don’t own us.

How do we do this? I would suggest that you create a map of your attachments - this is easy to do but requires practicing awareness of the mind. Whenever you notice a thought arising that has a strong emotion attached, especially fear, sadness, envy or anger, look for the attachment thats at the root. For example if you’re having a conversation with someone and something they said upsets you, then you can trace back through: what did they actually say? Is what I heard the same as what they meant? What is it about what they said that struck a nerve? What is it that I’m attached to that it resonated with? It might be your view of yourself or them, it could be a belief or an unrealised desire. 

Spend some time on the cushion meditating about that moment and use it as an opportunity to gain insight into your attachment. Once you’ve got there, record it somewhere safe and read through the list once a month. Make sure that you’re not judging yourself for having that attachment. 

Attachments have real power over us only as long as we’re not fully aware of them. Once we know where our buttons are we can be aware of the roots in our culture and our experiences. Seeing that golden thread allows us to let go of our suffering and be light, fresh and free.

The toy will become an indispensable gift for the holidays, for example, in the shape of a heart – for Valentine’s Day, Christmas trees or stars – for the New Year, a glow – in-the-dark ball with an original smiley face-for Halloween. Such a gift will be appropriate for the development of fine motor skills and attention in a child. You can use it to decorate the interior or use it for trainings and outdoor games in a team. Bright colors and textures are also uplifting.


 
Security measures
Inside the ball is liquid latex or silicone, which creates such a wonderful effect when squeezed. You should be careful with sharp objects and nail pressure, as they can cut the ball and cause the filler to spill out. Do not give the ball to small children or pets.


 
 


 
How to make an anti-stress ball at home
The soothing toy can be easily made by yourself. To do this, you will need ordinary inflatable balls of a round shape, a filler (store filler, flour, starch, small cereals, soda, sand, beans, lentils, peas) about one glass. You can mix several types of fillers to experiment with the density.


 
 


 
Preparation: take 2 inflatable balls, cut off the neck of one of them, starting from the round part. One ball should remain with the neck. You will also need a watering can, spoon, filler, thread, colored or black marker.


 
Instruction manual:
 


 
1. Take a balloon with a neck and inflate it slightly to straighten it.


 
2. Put the ball on the neck of the watering can and carefully pour a glass of filler inside. Level it out.


 
 

3. Tie the ball tightly and decorate the knot with a bow, a beautiful clip or a bubo made of thread.

 

4. Put a second, cropped one on top of this ball to make it more resistant to damage. You can experiment with the colors of the top layer.

 

5. Draw a funny face with a marker and the anti-stress ball is ready.

Desperately need some help,"I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress lately and today, cried all morning, even threw up. I have never done that before from stress. This is really long… 

A little bit of background: I have some childhood trauma, physical abuse, and emotional. I got pregnant at 17 and had my amazing son at 18. He is now 15 - not a source of stress whatsoever. Of course I worry about him but that’s normal. I also have an 8 year old boy who is equally as amazing, but a bit more demanding of my time and attention. I worry that I’m not doing enough to keep him on track in school, etc. I recently signed him up for soccer. 

I work 9-5 Monday through Friday. My job is not physically demanding, but very mentally draining. I love my job but I am writing notes for a psychiatrist during appointments. These appointments are 15 minutes back to back. I am sitting typing for about 8 hours, listening to a lot of trauma and issues. 

I lost my stepfather 3 years ago, who I was very close to. When I lost him, I also lost his family - I had a stepsister and nephews that I loved. The reason I lost them is another story in itself (family drama with my mom etc). My mom got remarried quickly despite my objections to take her time and grieve. She got remarried behind my back and only told me after she was married. We were very close before this. The man she married is not horrible but has a bit of a shady background. He did something he should have apologized to me for, but never has. I don’t feel comfortable visiting my mom. 

Anyway, my days lately are jam packed. My boyfriend works second shift and has trouble getting to sleep at night and doesn’t help much around the house anymore. I understand he’s working 10 hour days. Every responsibility is on me. I am also taking two online college courses. 

Work, take kid to soccer, make dinner, clean up, laundry, homework, and by the time I’m done with everything, its 11pm. I’m not getting enough sleep. I’m waking up angry. 

It’s important to note that I have ADHD and prescribed a stimulant med, which does mess with my sleep. If I don’t take it, I have significant difficulty focusing and staying on task. 

I just need some suggestions on how you all deal with life and don’t let things overwhelm you. I can’t afford therapy right now and definitely don’t have the time for it. Please help, I’m burning out bad.",[deleted],4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/phstp6/desperately_need_some_help/,0
"Workplace-related stress. Any tips for ""reprogramming"" myself?","Hi there,

I'm  pretty sure I've noticed health problems that have been caused by or at  least exacerbated by the stress of my workplace, including tight or shallow breathing, heart palpitations, and nerve issues. I say workplace and not just ""job"" because, although of course the job creates stress, I almost feel it's the place itself that I've developed negative associations with, if that's possible. (And it's not just due to sitting, by the way. I'm  actually on my feet a lot.)

I wonder if anybody has experience with this and if there is some way I can rewire my brain so that I'm not having what I perceive to be almost allergic reactions to my workplace. Or if there are exercises — mental or physical — that might help.

I'd appreciate any tips. Thank you.",dakl,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/phnjh1/workplacerelated_stress_any_tips_for/,0

Overthinking,How can I stop my overthinking ?,Early-Cap8520,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pfw6an/overthinking/,0
School fucked me up,"Just wanna find a vent 

I’ve always been the all A’s student at my school and everyone has so much expectations on me.
I’ve always have this cheerful bubbly personality on the outside, but I’ve never been actually happy about my current life.

I feel so stressed and i kept crying constantly because of academic pressure and my teacher’s expectation.
It has gotten to the point where I can’t take care of myself and I even took a day off from school because of that recently. (Happened about 2 weeks ago)

I’ve picked myself up but ever since that incident I will cry for no reason and have a mental breakdown over really small things. 
My motivation has been decreasing rapidly and I’ll constantly isolate myself from interacting with anyone.
I just got scolded by my mom and I’m now all by myself, crying alone.
My concentration has also become worse the older I got, I used to be able to read a book in one sitting, now I can’t even finish a single page of homework.
I’ve been struggling so hard to get my work done but I can’t.
I had to stay up really late every night (2am - 4am) only to get my work done.
But I have to wake up 7am in the morning everyday for school.
It’s honestly torturing and I literally wanna die.  

Aside from mental health issues, it causes my body to react negatively, I stopped having my period whenever school starts and I will gain fat really rapidly.
The more fat I gain, the more insecure I get, I don’t even wanna go out because of my fat body.

I tried to tell my friends, they are really supportive, but whenever my depressive feelings strike, I just don’t have the motivation to speak to them, I wanna keep them out from my negative feelings, the same goes to my family.

School and academic stress has fucked me up entirely but I cannot stop it.
I cannot quit school or I will lose my seemingly “bright” future, but I don’t know how long I can do this anymore. 

TLDR : school gave me too much pressure for being the top student, fucked up my mental and physical health.
I cannot do this anymore.",MissCandy1227,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pf6bl0/school_fucked_me_up/,0

How to cope with never beeing alone?,"Well like the title says. Techniques on how to relax even when I'm never alone? 

A good year ago I needed to move and the intention was to temporarly move in with my parent to find a new place. But then covid came and the prises of house skyrocketed with no end inside (for now). And on my own it's about impossible to buy one at the moment (also a stressor). So I'm a bit stuck there.

I'm an introvert and I really really need my time completely alone. And at the start my parents went a weekend away, went on holiday so I got my time alone once in a while and I could cope. My dad had a heart attack in april and with that went my alone time. He still needs a second treatment but that gets delayed time after time. So they stay home and like every weekend (when I'm free) friends and family visit. I need my weekends to relax a bit and now they are the most stressfull days of the week. Because I need them to be one thing and they now are the opposite.

I got a couple of hobbies. Biggest one of which is woodworking. I mostly do everything from my mind, like calculating, measurement etc. and I need to concentration. But whenever I start within minutes one of them comes by all interested and bla bla and puls me out of my concentration. Finally done, within 15 minutes the second one comes and does the same. And short my dad always starts helping as he is bored as hell. But he doesn't have the energy so everything is very slow and blocks me from enjoying any of it. Also explaining every step gets old. My hobby is normally my escape from reality and he makes it his and that stresses me out big time. My escape became a stressor. But how do I say to my dad, please go and do something else as he can't do much at the moment. 

Now I have 3 weeks of holiday (first already gone) and I mostly sit in my room making plans for what to build, play video games and build lego sets. As that is the only thing I can do without being interupted to much.The what you want for diner, I'm going to the supermarket, I need this will you get it for me, can you help with, want some thea, etc. So even then they make it very clear I'm not alone.

My mom just doesn't get it, she is an extravert and everyone should be like that is her opinion. She isn't going to change. My dad I never had a problem with but since he's sick he has been a bit different (understandably). He needs an escape aswel and chooses whatever I'm doing. 

I 'm getting very cranky, restless during the day, annoyed, just stressed out. In the last 2 weeks of my holiday I really need a way to calm down and to relax. As if I start working again with this mindset I go nuts.

Sorry for the rant but any techniques, ideas, food (suplements), whatever that can calm me down short term are very welcome. Long term, my dad will have his second treatment and they will go out again, and I will find my own place again.",Dutch-Sculptor,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pf89mc/how_to_cope_with_never_beeing_alone/,0

9 ways to lower cortisol levels and prevent stress," 

### [Stress](https://www.vmira.com/stress-and-ways-to-overcome-it/) is the body’s response to a potential threat that may be related to physical and psychological factors. Learn about the role of cortisol in stress and how to lower cortisol.

Cortisol is one of the hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. It is involved in many metabolic processes, such as helping to regulate blood pressure and blood sugar levels. In addition, it plays a role in the awakening process after sleep. When you wake up, your hormone levels rise, peaking after [30 minutes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3581252/) and then gradually decreasing throughout the day.

Cortisol is also called the “stress hormone”. When your body feels threatened, physically or psychologically, your brain sends a signal to your adrenal glands, and they release cortisol in response. This hormone improves concentration, blood circulation, and glucose synthesis – this helps the body release additional energy to cope with stress more effectively.

Despite the benefits of cortisol, frequent or prolonged increases in cortisol levels can be harmful to the body. For example, chronic stress causes cortisol dysfunction, which leads to inflammation, depression, and accelerated cell aging. It is also associated with the development of osteoporosis, muscular dystrophy, and decreased antitumor immunity.

&gt;**Chronic stress occurs as a result of repeated exposure to situations that result in the release of stress hormones, including cortisol.**

We’ve compiled nine evidence-based ways to naturally lower cortisol levels and manage stress. This will help your body to experience a state of mobilization less often to eliminate a potential threat.

*This article is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be used to diagnose or treat or replace professional advice.*

## 1. Identify the factors provoking stress

Threats to life or change of scenery are irritants that provoke anxiety and can become a trigger or stress factor. These irritants include physical pain, relationship or work problems, and financial difficulties. It is, of course, impossible to predict when you will hit the chair with your foot. But some types of triggers can be learned to recognize.

 

One of the first steps to relieve stress is to understand what is causing it. I don’t want to remember and think about unpleasant situations. But a stress diary can help you recognize stimuli so you can be less responsive to them. It is not necessary to remember all the details of an unpleasant event – it is enough to write down the fact and try to analyze why the incident caused you a negative reaction.

With a stress diary, you can find practical ways to deal with these situations. For example, avoiding quarrels, learning to build personal [boundaries in relationships](https://atlas.ru/blog/5-prichin-pochiemu-zdorovie-i-samochuvstviie-chielovieka-zavisit-ot-liubvi/) and at work, and saying “no” in time. Moreover, you will be able to identify hidden causes of stress like hanging on social media.

## 2. Learn to recognize thoughts that cause stress

Reflecting on negative and traumatic events is a trigger for the synthesis of cortisol. British scientists conducted a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453012002557?via%3Dihub#bib0015) in which participants recorded their most negative memories for 20 minutes over three days. The results showed that this caused the participants to have high levels of cortisol. [Scientists](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022399905002151?via%3Dihub) attribute this to long-term effects on the entire body.

 

Also, the scientific community highlights the role of anxiety and looping on negative thoughts in stress levels. [It has been proven](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00971/full) that negative thinking not only increases cortisol levels but also badly affects the production of oxytocin, a hormone that calms the nervous system.

The mental practice of mindfulness is one way to combat negative thinking and helps lower cortisol levels. Hungarian scientists conducted a [meta-analysis of](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2020.1760727) ten studies on the relationship between meditation and stress hormone levels. The results showed that meditation has a positive effect on people living under stressful conditions, but especially on patients with depression and PTSD.

## 3. Pay attention to the quality of your sleep.

A person who has slept well will find it easier to deal with the effects of stress and unpleasant situations. But it’s not just the quality and duration of sleep that affect cortisol levels. What time you go to bed and wake up also plays a role. Research [shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453012002648) that people who work night shifts and sleep during the day are more likely to have elevated cortisol levels.

Shift work under the age of 40 is associated with a higher body mass index (BMI) and higher cortisol levels.

Cortisol can be elevated due to lack of sleep, especially in the evening after a lack of sleep. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system is responsible for the production of cortisol. When a threat to the body appears, a part of the brain, the hypothalamus, synthesizes special substances that are sent to the pituitary epididymis. He, in turn, sends a signal to the adrenal glands. In response, the adrenal cortex releases cortisol, some of which again enters the brain, affecting the thinking process. This relationship between the brain and the kidneys is called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also responsible for regulating sleep cycles. Stress, illness, or poor nutrition can activate the axis. Subsequently, this can worsen your sleep and increase cortisol.

Sleep hygiene is one of the deciding factors in its quality. Try to create an environment in which the amount of noise and light is minimal. This will help blackout curtains, eye masks, earplugs.

**Tips for Improving Sleep Quality to Reduce Cortisol Levels:**

* Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time.
* Wash bedding and sleepwear regularly – fresh scent helps the body to relax
* Try not to use devices that emit blue light (TV, phone, tablet) 2-3 hours before bed
* Avoid caffeinated drinks in the afternoon
* Avoid excessive strength and cardio activities two hours before bed.

## 4. Exercise regularly

Exercise can either increase or decrease cortisol levels, depending on the duration and intensity of the exercise. Despite the benefits of playing sports, it is still a load and stress for the body. Therefore, as a result of intense exercise, cortisol usually rises briefly, but then falls at night.

At the same time, moderate-intensity exercise does not lead to an increase in stress hormone levels. Like vigorous exercise, moderate exercise is associated with a decrease in cortisol levels at night.

With regular exercise, cortisol levels can be controlled. And in addition to lowering the stress hormone, sports have a good effect on the microbiota. But it’s best to avoid strenuous evening workouts that will keep you awake. Physical activity isn’t just good for the body – many doctors recommend it to improve mental health as well.

## 5. Find something to do

Learning how to relax is really beneficial, especially if you want to manage stress. A new hobby is one way that also helps you learn a new skill. It doesn’t matter what you do, the main thing is that you enjoy the activity

 

American scientists conducted a [study of](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030115/) 50 former combatants who experienced depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance abuse. They practiced gardening and occupational therapy for a month. The results showed a decrease in stress and a decrease in cortisol.

Think about what activity you will enjoy – perhaps it is drawing, music, or gardening.

## 6. Laugh often.

Laughter is good not only for the soul but also for the body. It is a natural way to overcome stress and reduce cortisol levels. [A study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080407114617.htm) published in 2008 found that even the anticipation of laughter leads to a decrease in blood levels of cortisol, as well as two other stress hormones, adrenaline, and norepinephrine.

&gt;**Laughter lowers not only stress hormone levels, but also blood pressure.**

If you are having a fun and interesting time, you are unlikely to experience a lot of stress at the same time. This is why it is so important to plan your time and visit interesting places and events.

## 7. Communicate with animals

It has been scientifically proven that contact with animals is associated with decreased cortisol levels. Scientists have [studied](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24170391/) how interaction with animals affects stress and found that long-term interaction with dogs, even strangers, as well as pet ownership, has a positive effect on cortisol levels. In addition, the interaction between man and dog increases the level of oxytocin in both.

 

Pets are associated not only with reduced stress levels but other health benefits as well. For owners of cats, dogs, parrots, and other pets, it is easier to focus attention. Also, animals have a positive effect on blood pressure and help to avoid feelings of loneliness.

## 8. Add cortisol-lowering foods to your diet.

Nutrition affects not only metabolic processes in the body but also the level of cortisol. Certain foods, such as sugar, can increase the amount of stress hormone.

Neurotransmitter chemicals are responsible for transmitting signals to the nervous system and controlling mood. And hormones and food are responsible for their production.

**How to reduce cortisol through nutrition**

Foods rich in polyphenols can help reduce stress hormone levels. For example, the long-term health benefits of drinking green tea are scientifically proven – drinking as little as half a glass a day reduces the risk of depression and dementia.

Eating the foods in the table below will help control your stress hormone levels:

**FoodBeverages**BananasBlack teaDark chocolateGreen teaPlant fibersProbiotics (yogurt)Probiotics (sauerkraut)Water

Remember that seizing stress only provides temporary relief and can lead to eating disorders, weight gain, and blood sugar problems. During times of stress, try to choose foods containing plant fiber – fiber provides a feeling of fullness for a long time and regulates blood sugar levels.

Regular sugar intake is associated with long-term high cortisol levels and is associated with a higher risk of heart disease in overweight men.

**Probiotics**

The gut microbiota contains trillions of bacteria that are beneficial to your health. They strengthen the intestinal lining, fight inflammation, regulate the immune system, and even mental health. This is why it is important to take care of the composition of the gut bacteria.

Among the inhabitants of the gut microbiota are probiotic bacteria that reduce cortisol levels and, consequently, stress. Among them are the bacteria *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus* and *L. farciminis.*

Probiotic foods help maintain healthy gut bacteria. Dairy drinks like kefir and yogurt, as well as fermented foods like kimchi, contain certain strains of probiotic bacteria. They help reduce stress-induced cortisol levels. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28101105/) shows that one Lactobacillus strain, *L. Plantarum 299v,* reduces exam stress in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

With the [Atlas Microbiota Test,](https://atlas.ru/microbiome/?utm_content=/blog/9-sposobov-snizit-uroven-kortizola-i-predotvratit-stress/) you can learn about the bacterial diversity of your gut as well as assess the level of probiotic bacteria.

## 9. Spend time in nature

The noise of the big city, rush, and traffic jams are part of the life of many people, but not everyone realizes the degree of the negative impact of such an atmosphere on physical and mental health. Even a park or nature reserve within the city limits is a great opportunity to recover and relax.

 

Forest therapy is a part of life for most Japanese people. They call her “shining-Youku” which translates to “forest baths.” This is the practice of walking in a park or forest for 2-4 hours, which includes contemplation of nature and deep breathing. As [proved by scientists](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19568835/), this pastime reduces cortisol levels, normalize heart rate and blood pressure.

&gt;**Deep breathing reduces heart rate, improves mood, and reduces stress.**

There is no one-size-fits-all method of dealing with stress – every organism and brain is unique. Good sleep, proper nutrition, and regular physical activity are the basis for a healthy body. Now you also know what other scientifically proven ways to prevent and reduce stress.

What can an alarm tell you?," 

In life, everything is calm and, at first glance, there is no reason to worry, but suddenly there is an inexplicable **feeling of** [**anxiety**](https://vmira.com/6-foods-that-increase-anxiety-and-may-cause-depression/) **and fear**. At first, it is rare and imperceptible, but over time, the manifestations become more frequent, and the reaction becomes stronger. Perhaps every case of anxiety is accompanied by a physical sensation: pain in the chest, neck, abdomen, shivers all over the body or sharply throws in a sweat. At this moment, it is impossible to suppress the sudden fear with the power of reason, but it subsides by itself, without letting you figure out what the reasons for the alarm were.

## Anxiety, anxiety, or fear

Each of these similar feelings (anxiety, anxiety, fear) has a different basis, but their manifestations are similar. All of them make a person experience negative emotions, unpleasant, exhausting. They can deprive you of strength, affect a person’s social life, prevent you from concentrating, awaken a sense of defenselessness, confusion, and loneliness.

The strongest and most explicable emotion in this group is fear. This feeling occurs in response to a real danger, to a situation that has happened in the past, or when a person knows the experience of negative developments in similar circumstances. Fear helps a person avoid real danger, warns them, and forces them to gather all their strength to deal with the upcoming negative event. Fear can take hold of a person at the sight of a dog, if he has ever been hurt by it before or has seen it attack another person. It can also be unrelated to physical suffering, for example, a person is silent because he is afraid of being misunderstood by his interlocutor.

Unlike fear, the feeling of anxiety it has no valid obvious reasons. This feeling can take hold on the eve of a meeting, when the responsible specialist is well prepared, has answers to all the predicted questions, but is afraid of the unknown. After all, he does not know how the meeting will be held, what additional questions will be raised, and whether he will be able to answer them. Anxiety takes hold when an employee, as is often the case, is called by the manager without explanation. There is still no reason for fear, because a person can not know what the conversation will be about, but the alarming uncertainty makes you worry, experience physical discomfort.

In personal life, feelings of anxiety and anxiety can occur in light premonitions and suspicions that the spouse is cheating. There is no evidence of infidelity, but there is no confidence in the honesty of a loved one. At these moments, anxiety often sets in for the future of relationships, family, children, and your own.

Anxiety constantly accompanies a person throughout life. Exams at school, institute, employment, waiting for a doctor’s appointment, a teenager who was delayed from a walk – all these are causes for alarm, which have grounds and reasons. A person, looking at the current situation, assumes the consequences, based on their own or someone else’s experience.

Anxiety is the inappropriate occurrence of anxiety attacks. It is causeless and has no objective external prerequisites. Causeless anxiety can occur at certain times of the day, most often at night, or be situational in nature, for example, on the way to work. At the same time, a person cannot connect the appearance of this feeling with any thoughts, words, events, or environment.

Anxiety attacks are difficult to cope with, understand, overcome, they are difficult, almost impossible to overcome on their own, because their cause is not found on the surface. The root of anxiety is in the individual unconscious, in the past, or in worries about the future.

If you feel frequent bouts of anxiety, do not postpone contacting a specialist. Sometimes anxiety can only be a symptom of a neurosis that can be treated in the initial, untreated stages. A psychologist will help you figure out how to get rid of feelings of anxiety.

## Signs of anxiety

Anxiety can be expressed not only in emotional sensations, but also on a physical level. When the next restless state occurs, a person may feel:

Problems with concentration, absent-mindedness;

Fatigue;

Fussiness;

I’m thirsty;

Chills;

Sweating;

Rapid heartbeat;

Vertigo;

Lack of air;

Muscle pain all over the body;

Pain in the solar plexus area;

Sensation of a lump in the throat.

When the attack subsides, the symptoms disappear, but fatigue, confusion, and weakness remain. If you repeat several such attacks, you should contact a psychologist who will help you decipher the symptoms, their connections with the emotional state, stress, experiences, problems or events.

## Causes of anxiety

The origins of an inexplicable state of excitement are as different as the people themselves. There is a percentage of people who have never felt anything like this in their life. At the same time, 10% of the world’s population is constantly experiencing gratuitous anxiety. Many people are periodically exposed to powerful waves of anxiety, the causes of which they do not know, can not understand.

Each person is full of needs that do not always correspond to their capabilities. Sometimes opportunities are objectively not enough to achieve the intended goal and meet the need. Psychological balance is a balance between the needs and capabilities of a person. Often, the key to understanding anxiety lies precisely in the imbalance of these two components, but it is impossible to find the stumbling block that does not allow you to realize opportunities and achieve your goals independently without an objective assessment.

To understand the true causes of constant feelings of anxiety, it is worth analyzing past events, expected upcoming ones, current relationships and states – everything that is important and expensive, and that may be in danger. However, the problem with introspection is that a person cannot take an objective position, so he does not see the real sources of experience, goes around in circles and increasingly aggravates his condition with a new fear – the inability to cope with anxiety.

## How can a psychologist help?

Anxiety is not a disease if it is not linked to neuroses, so diagnosis and long-term medication treatment are not required. A psychologist can be of great help in this situation. This specialist, like no one else, knows how to get rid of feelings of anxiety. The psychologist will be able to plan an individual work program, choose a program and a suitable method.

The psychologist’s actions are gentle, but the steps are gradual. It does not change the psychological state and does not heal in the traditional sense of the word. The psychologist helps you step by step to get to the level of the unconscious, which is the source of inexplicable fear.

For example, one man experienced periodic feelings of anxiety at night. He wasn’t afraid of the dark, robbers, or any other sudden threats to his life. His work was stable, and his family life was peaceful. The attacks were accompanied by a sharp pain in the solar plexus, after a few minutes the pain passed, and the anxiety receded. Inadequate conditions were repeated several times a week, because of which the man did not get enough sleep, real problems with physical health began, lagging behind schedule at work.

After lengthy clinical examinations of the body and useless courses of treatment, the man found the strength to make an appointment with a psychologist. In the process of communicating with the specialist, a personal tragedy that occurred several years ago, related to the death of his first wife, surfaced. Every time he fell asleep, he would go back to that situation and relive it, fearing for the life of his current wife and his own. Psychological counseling helped him cope with the past and turn to the present. The sudden bouts of anxiety never returned.

Recognizing a problem and asking for help is both difficult and simple. The solution will not be quick or easy, but the first step will always be the most difficult. If anxiety has become a problem and affects the usual course of life, do not postpone a visit to a specialist.",ennagraoui,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/pc5zo6/what_can_an_alarm_tell_you/,0

My anti stress plan,"I've been dealing with a life-altering chronic illness for the last 2 years.  Historically, I deal with stress with weight-lifting, cardio, and dance (I used to train 7 to 14 hours a week)  Since I've become sick, I've lost all of my friends, can no longer dance, and can't weight lift.    I know that stress exacerbates my illness, but the illness also causes most of my stress and robs me of my life-long tools for dealing with stress.

I'm directly dealing with stress, but here's my overall plan

* Make better use of a calendar to plan responsibilities.  That way, I can forget about the problem until the reminder shows up.
* Put things in perspective and accept the bad things in life/work instead of worry about them
* Try to laugh and smile
* Take a cold shower when I get home from work.

"I burned out 2 years ago, in one week I'll start work 100% again. Here's my biggest takeaways!","Almost two years ago, I burned out. PROPERLY. And it's been such a tough &amp; long journey back, and heck, it still is! My body truly shut down and couldn't do anything, no energy, headaches, memory loss, emotional turbulence aka crying a lot, and lots more symptoms I never thought I'd experience.

Finally starting to experience a (NEW) normal life again, I look back at this experience with a lot of reflections and insights. 

It's hard to find the balance between doing too much and too little. A new life with new perspectives, lessons learned and adapted goals ahead.

BUT, with that said, there are two things I would like to say to everyone out there who thinks they are immortal. Or heck, you'll get three while I'm at it. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. YOU ARE NOT IMMORTAL. I was convinced of it because since it felt like I had an inexhaustible amount of energy and ENJOYED what I was doing, 24/7. Life was FUN! Turned out my mind and body didn't care too much about that...

2. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Whatever you think you'll get that requires you to skip sleep and neglect all your friends and time to recuperate and relax - the cost is way beyond its true value. AT LEAST when you push yourself as hard as I did. 

3. FIND THE BALANCE! Get to know your limits  (USE COMMON SENSE) BUT, don't use stories and excuses to not do what you really should do! AKA don't go LAZY! Life is incredibly boring and meaningless if we don't advance towards something that means something to us. As Mark Manson puts it - It's about finding problems that you WANT to solve in life, and then put your energy into doing so.

NOTE - This is 100% my view and perception of life.

You can break the chains of past experiences through increasing awareness of your underlying beliefs/assumptions - allowing arising thoughts to pass through your awareness before acting frees your perception and lets you take a new path,"Assumptions can reduce our capacity to cope with reality and lead us to suffering - when we assume we can distort our perception of others and have a negative effect on relationships and ourselves. 

The first step is accepting that we don’t perceive reality, we instead view the world through a lens of our beliefs. Some of these we’re aware of (like our political or religious beliefs), some of them we’re less aware of, like how we view ourselves and other people. Its easy to demonstrate this: if you think of a time where you were in an argument with someone and were exasperated because you couldn’t understand why they didn’t see things your way, it was at least partly because they are viewing the same situation and the same information through a different lens of beliefs, experience, culture, politics etc. Accepting that you and everyone else has this lens and letting go of the idea of objective observation is key.

The next step is to approach the world with beginners mind - where we look at the world with a lack of preconceptions like a child. We can look at life the same way, even things we’re very familiar with - there’s a phrase “know it like the back of your hand” but you can look at the back of your hand and see it for the first time. Looking at your hand you can see the skin, the nails, the bones and joints under the skin, the ligaments. You start to question how well you actually know the back of your hand, I’m not sure I could pick it out from a lineup of hands.

We also need to be aware of our thoughts as they arise, particularly judgemental thoughts. We don’t need to punish ourselves or berate ourselves but simply notice when a judgement arises - that might be |""I don’t like what he’s saying"" ""this tea’s a bit hot"", or ""I shouldn’t be feeling this way."" We can allow the judgement to pass through our awareness without latching on to it, without doing anything about it. In letting it pass through then we can reduce our own suffering and we can get back to experiencing the present moment.

However if we choose to do so, we can meditate on judgements, beliefs or perceptions and understand the roots. We can take one, for example judging yourself unkindly for making an error at work, make the connection with experiences in our past where beliefs are formed, with relationships with other people, with the culture within our own workplace. By make those connections we can gain insight and start to liberate ourselves from suffering.

What you say and how you think can absolutely give you disease and it can absolutely cure you of disease.,"
The mind can turn the body's pH from acidic to alkaline in a matter of minutes.

If you want to prevent disease, be happy, eliminate depression and fatigue, and cure any disease you have, you absolutely categorically must reduce stress that is in your body. It is impossible to say ""eliminate all stress,"" but you certainly can reduce stress. 

Health-care practitioners around the world have proven over and over again that by simply reducing stress diseases are cured. Even medical doctors cannot deny the power of the mind in healing the body. 

The placebo affect has been proven by even the pharmaceutical industry! The placebo affect has shown that up to 40 percent of people cure themselves with nothing more than thoughts.

That comes directly from the pharmaceutical industry's own literature. That is a natural cure they don't want you to know about.

So I am sharing with you a simple practice to reduce stress through this 5 minute [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/AhIAF1zMobk) that deals with your spiritual chills (energy under your goosebumps) which goes by many different names like Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more.

Our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh is conducting a research study to measure how people experience **stress**. If you are a US citizen or resident between the ages of 18-65 years old, you are eligible to participate! The study involves filling out some questionnaires about how stress manifests itself in your body.

Asian parents is guilt tripping me on paying their rent. 18yo in need of guidance,"Hi I live in Malaysia, I'm 18yo going to be 19yo this coming November. I have two sister, one is 20yo another is 22yo. 

I have just graduated from high school and my mother is asking me to help pay for rent, I don't have any skill I have only just started learning to code whereas both my sister had a few year break and is playing games 24/7 even right now they are playing. Although one is studying biomedical whenever she have free time is just games. My parents doesn't have much money left and we r just barely getting by but my parents continue to buy useless/ unnecessary snack, coffee etc. Also my mother likes to waste water by cleaning the floor multiple times with just only water (OCD) not soap even when I have already clean it. I have also already told them many many times (throughout 11 - 18yo) to not buy any more snack, and have told my mother that washing with water does not really clean the area and also told my sister to help out with the chores at least. But my effort is all for nothing, I have only added extra stress in my life.

Is it wrong to think that this is unfair or am I being in the wrong here? Because when I'm telling my sister to learn some skill instead of playing games they get defensive and started to argue with me. I didn't force them to learn I'm just telling them that they should learn something instead of playing games whole day

My parents father 60+yo, mother 50+yo both have not work for a really long time. I won't and can't tell them to work because they r my parents, and I'm still living under their roof 

I have already gave up telling them what to do, because of this I have learned that you can't actually tell people what to do if they not willing to listen, and change. 

I'm In constant stress, my parents doesn't allow me to work because of Covid. So instead while I still have roof under my head I'm doing everything I can to learn the necessary coding skill / graphic design so I can start working. 

When I was younger I told my mother I will help with the rent but that was a year ago I didn't really think that through, my mistake on my part. Now my mother is guilt tripping me to pay for the rent. I'm using my allowance and am also out of cash ( shouldn't even be called allowance since I'm technically returning the money )

Because of this stress, I'm also constantly thinking why do so many people have a child when they are not financially stable or mentally prepared to be a parent. What do people expect when they have a child? Isn't it just a cycle, baby, adolescent, teenager &gt; go college, young adult &gt; start working, old adult &gt; retired and have a child. Then cycle repeats again and again. In my case my parent want me to continue the family name.

What would your advice be?
Am I being a spoiled child?

Note: My parents is loving but to me they r not ready to be a parent. ( They always argue, talk about money in front of me and my sister, not telling my sister to do any chore. Etc ). I don't have any driving license and my parents are also quite strict I quite embarrassed to say this but I cant ride on a public bus without their permission first. I had my Covid shot but parent still won't let me work outside.My sister is not helping to pay rent, I can't tell them what to do because they will go defensive and we will be in an argument again

Online Mindfulness-based Therapy for Stress Management,"Emotional stress is something that we all experience when we have to cope with the many demands and responsibilities of home and work. Stress can be defined as an intense emotional and physiological reaction to a situation or the mental representation of a situation as a memory or anticipation.

Chronic stress is produced when stress reactions do not resolve themselves and become habitual. The sustained physiological effects of chronic stress can have a serious effect on the body and lead to an increased risk of disease.

The psychological effects of chronic stress produce fatigue, poor concentration and an impaired ability to perform tasks, which leads to more stress. Stress produces a general feeling of helplessness and negativity, both of which reinforce the stress reactions. We feel a lack of vitality, enthusiasm and creativity. Many people describe chronic stress as a heavy blackness that covers everything.

Chronic stress can result in an increased chance of accidents as well as reducing work performance. Chronic stress also reduces our listening and learning skills and this reduces the quality of communication in our personal relationships and family. Chronic stress is a problem that greatly impacts those around us as well as reducing the quality of our own life.

When left untreated, chronic stress can lead to problems with anger management, which in turn feeds the underlying stress reactions. Stress can also lead to depression and addiction, which is a common reaction to depression.

Mindfulness training and therapy provides a very effective way to work with stress and overcome the emotional suffering component so you are better able to deal with the demands of life.

I tried using it in conjunction with Khan Academy, but something about Khan Academy is not helpful, their questions are but not their videos.

What are best methods to beat work-related stress?,"Stress is the feeling of tension in your body due to physical or emotional stressors. Emotional stressors might be anger, frustration, or nervousness. 

When we feel stressed, we will have physical symptoms like

Increased heart rate and blood pressure, 
Pain in the chest and body aches, 
Headaches, 
Trouble sleeping, 
Muscle tensions, 
Digestive issues
Weakened immune system, 
Loss of sexual desire or ability, 
Teeth grinding or clenching the jaw often, 
Fidgeting, 
Pacing, 
Changes in appetite, 

These physical symptoms can worsen over time. This is why self-care is so important. Take care of yourself and your stress now, rather than putting it off or ignoring it. Coming up with a stress management plan is one good way to urge an edge on stress and stop it from ruining your life. Here is what you can do

Chronic stress relief— PLEASE HELP!,"Hi, I am writing this post because I am— to be blunt— very desperate for stress relief. I am only 19, but about half of my life has been spent trying to cope with things that were abnormally stressful (in comparison to my peers). My parents getting divorced in 5th grade quickly turned into my mother being emotionally abusive, my new stepdad making my mom’s house very unsafe, and my mom taking his side and doing very out of pocket things to try to get us to pity her (pretending to be stalked, faking cancer, allegedly being “poisoned,” etc.)… Ever since this began, I had always followed an escapist route, so much so like that I developed a form of psychosis that led me to believe that this world was entirely a dream (and that I had more control over things than I actually do). I have undergone a lot of persona, mental illness related troubles as well, and it truly seems as if there is no situational stress relief. 
In February of 2020, however, things took a turn for the worse. Due to extenuating circumstances, I was facing an incredible amount of financial stress, and had to scrounge for money to buy dinner. I started experiencing debilitating stomach pain that doctors could not pinpoint. Quarantine followed shortly thereafter, and then I moved 2 hours away from everyone/everything in order to go to college. I had no money and no friends, and my grades began to slip. My stomach pains got worse, and then I also started to experience sleep issues that make it virtually impossible to wake up on time for work, class, etc. unless I have slept 12+ hours. I have seen so many specialists, to no avail, and these health issues simply exacerbate all of the other familial, academic, and financial burdens I am facing.
I have been trying to be as patient as I can, but I have now been told that the majority of my health issues are caused by stress itself. This is a catch-22 in many ways, and this news in and of itself is a stressor. Now, I am hyper-aware of my stress, and feel like I can’t do anything without getting chest pains.
I am getting a new psychiatrist and therapist, but my appointments are not for a while, but I am not functional until then! I do things to destress daily (art, talking to my family/boyfriend, etc.) but it’s clearly not enough. Any help is appreciated!

19year old In need of help and guidancr,"Hi everyone, I'm a 19year old male just finished highschool. I will get straight to the point

College is too expensive. parents can't afford it, even if they can I wouldn't want to burden them. I will want to pay for my own college. But the problem right now is that my parents are retired. I'm really worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I can't help them because my parents don't allow me to get a job because of the covid. I know I'm an adult but I don't have a driving license or a car yet. So instead I'm just learning to code day till night every single day. I need at least 6month to be job ready. I hope that I can get a front end job by then. I have many things to learn ( web design, color theory, SEO, coding etc).

I have only just started learning to code 1month ago. I feel so stupid and idiotic for not starting it earlier.

Negative thoughts have been haunting me recently, Is like I develop another personality. This personality only thinks of the bad thing for example like wanting to stab someone / myself, thinking of parents passing away etc. This kind of thoughts is appearing more often with each day passing.

Also there is a side of me that feel like I'm missing out because all of my friends and classmate are all in college. 

This kind of negative thinking didn't appear at all when I was in school but because I heard from parents that they don't have enough money. Is been bothering me ever since

I won't blame my parent and I know where I am now, I will work my way to get it but my headache and stress is getting worse every passing day, Im not taking any day off. Im very worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to learn the things needed. I'm really scared that my parent 60+yo will passed away early. All of this is stressing me out really badly I want to help them but I don't know how I can help. I don't have allowance. Worse is that I don't have any skill or talent.

I feel like I don't have enough time to learn the things I need to learn because there so many. Sometimes it doesn't even get absorbs by my head because I'm rushing it.

Also recently I've been biting my nail and scratching my head till bleeding. I never had this habit before.",Maxwell6181,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/oum9oa/19year_old_in_need_of_help_and_guidancr/,0

Yoga Exercises &lt;-&gt; Stress Reduction," Yoga helps reduce stress by lowering your body’s cortisol and adrenaline levels.

 How does these two critical stress hormones work: 

 When you feel stressed or anticipate something stressful about to happen, your stress response is triggered. As a result, your body releases stress hormones to help you become more alert, make your heart beat faster, and spike your blood pressure. All of these are a result of your body getting flooded by stress hormones ( including cortisol and adrenaline). 

 Being constantly stressed, can become harmful to your health.

"I've read that we aren't aware of 90% of what is going on around us. (In terms of energy, electromagnetic fields, vibrations, spirits, angels, brainwaves, wavelengths, frequencies and ect.)","

Personally I believe in this especially because I've experienced a lot of events that many would consider ""weird, hallucinations, paranormal and spiritual"".

For example, I was put in a life threatening situation which, as soon as I was able to close my eyes and try to rest, my consciousness was rapidly drawn into a vision of the location and situation I was at.

This vision showed me what to do in the near future(right after I wake up) to avoid any bad outcome of the situation I was in.

This was an eye opener to me because, it made me aware that, there is a sort of ability inside of my mind, that unlocked to suggest through a vision what I should do right after I wake up. Which would eventually save me from making a bad decision.

If you are interested I've made this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/Gfd54plueg8) about how to consciously use third-eye visions for whatever personal use.

Holding a job is too hard,"I quit my first job recently. The reason? I have been late for two times and my manager is telling me that.  Why was I late? Because I tried to do a personal leave due to period problems, but he replied me late, so I went to the job anyway. Now he forced me to sign the late paper and I know it is going to stay with me forever. I know my later employee would call the company and knew that I have been late for 2 times in a month. Lol.
However, for this job, I had to work at least 9.5 hours everyday from Monday to Friday. I refused to work overtime during weekends because I cannot have no time to wash my clothes, buy groceries, or do anything to recharge myself. I dont have a nanny to take care of me. I dont want to starve to death just for the ridiculous lower 25 percentile for my profession salary.
Now I am trying to land a job in my major. I am working hard to practice my interview skills but I dont see improvements. I am depressed.

"If you feel like you're just an anxious person and nothing can change that, give meditation another look","From my earliest memories I remember being anxious. I would always find something to worry about and this carried over into my adult life and got worse rather than better. I'd worry about school, I’d worry about how people viewed me, I’d look for things to worry about and cling onto them, ruminate on them. When I couldn’t find something to worry about I’d just have this vague sense that things in my life weren’t going as they should. 

I was diagnosed with depression in my late teens but the real problem was that I was paralysed by fear. The concept of enjoying my life as it was and letting things unfold in their own time (as Jon Kabat Zinn puts it) was completely alien to me. The idea that I had all the conditions for happiness would have been offensive to me. As far as I viewed the world, my life was not as it ought to be, I was not as I ought to be and until that changed I couldn’t be happy. 

I received cognitive behavioural therapy in my twenties, which was really helpful (and I would recommend). I was able to create a good life for myself, I got a job, I had relationships and my mood improved but the anxiety never left me. Into my thirties I’d wake up feeling anxious; doing my job I felt anxious because everything had to be perfect; interacting with people I felt anxious because I was afraid of saying the wrong thing.

There was nothing I could distract myself with that would shift this constant feeling of impending doom. Then about 15 years ago, I ran a marathon with my family to raise money for MacMillan, a UK cancer charity that looked after my father when he was passing away. I found I really enjoyed running but I got a lot of injuries so started to do yoga. With focusing my awareness while doing the yoga every day I noticed a change for the first time. It wasn’t big but I could feel it, especially in work. I was noticeably calmer and I got curious about whether this heightened awareness could help. I realised I had been assuming that I was just an anxious person and nothing could be done but maybe - maybe something could change.

I started reading a book by Mark Williams on meditation and mentioned this to a friend, who coincidentally had started practicing as well. She suggested I go to sangha, a meditation group with her. It was about 2 hours of practice, guided sit, walking meditation, silent meditation, reading and sharing our experience. I walked out of the session feeling like a lot of the weight of my anxiety had been lifted off my shoulders, something I'd never experienced before. 

After attending regularly and practicing on my own, I felt for the first time that my life didn’t have to be dominated by fear. There was a practice I could use when I was struggling to help me to feel calm and happy, and that in itself - just knowing there was an alternative to letting my difficult feelings over whelm me - was transformative. I won’t claim that I never feel fear, anger or sadness, but that’s not the point. The point is that I can experience these emotions without suffering, something I never would have believed possible. To paraphrase Dune, I permit these feelings to pass over me and through me. I hope you can find peace in the practice too.

How can I better cope with having to work 40 hours a week?,"I’m currently off work with stress. Not just because of work but also because I have a lot going on right now. Being off work I’m still stressing about work though. I just wish I didn’t have to do it. I still can’t accept the idea that I have to do it.

How exactly does stress cause chest pain?,"I recently experienced a lot of stress at work and have been having acute chest pain for more than a week. Since I'm also drinking alcohol every evening to reduce the stress, I thought the alcohol caused the heart pains. So I went to a doctor, to find out.

After a series of tests, nothing abnormal whatsoever was found. Even though I was feeling a strong stabbing feeling in my heart area during the tests.

Normal blood pressure, no irregularities in heart beat, etc...

So it was concluded that it is stress related. But I still don't get it. The pain I'm feeling is very real. It's stabbing me in the heart and sometimes I'm feeling really faint and about to pass out.

The doctor says it can happen with stress. But I don't understand how?? How can my body feel so bad, yet all tests reveal that everything is perfectly normal?

But it’s frustrating because I’m a bit behind on the files (about a week and a half behind now), and continue to get more behind as more and more are assigned to me.  
And then one of my coworkers was able to have a full hour person phone call because of the free time he has. It’s frustrating.   
I’m also in grad school, and took 2 courses during summer so I just don’t have the time to work OT and get caught up.  
I also cry sometimes when I get overly stressed. I also have a few diagnoses (bipolar 2, adhd, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder), which I’m still in the process of finding the right mix of meds. There was short period of time where I cried at least once a week. The first time my boss had been around when I cried she made me feel like I was too weak to handle the job. But continued to assign me files. Since then I have avoided crying when she’s in the office. 
I was talking to my bf tonight. Kept talking over me, and would barely let me get a sentence out. And when I raised my voice to tell him he was talking over me he diverted the conversation to me yelling at him instead of acknowledging he was talking over me. He said he wasn’t talking over me. And then called me weak because I cry from work.  
I can’t talk to my friends about it, because my boss is part of the friend group so I don’t want her to think I’m still weak.

Stressed do the point of getting sick,"Hi everyone, I’m new but wasn’t sure where else to turn or what to do.

I recently got a new job after going out of my comfort zone and leaving my previous employer of 6 years. Since then, I have been trying to get myself out of debt and caught up on bills I’m behind on, as well as trying to just get back on my feet. It’s been a struggle, as I hate change, but I’m proud of myself.

My new job is salary, and since I’m newer, HR is slowly getting my login credentials for some things, including the pay portal. And the pay weeks aren’t the typical Sunday-Saturday, so I’m not too sure how it all works. 

Imagine my surprise when I got into work and saw an email from HR. Evidently after a payroll audit, they determined I’ve been paid $1100 too much, so it’ll be deducted from my next paycheck.

I am freaking out. I have bills budgeted and in auto pay. My dog has an expensive procedure scheduled for next Friday. And that $1100 is almost my entire check. 

I emailed HR and asked if it could be divided among multiple pays, and I am praying they agree to that. Otherwise, what else do I do?",Outrageous-Yogurt-80,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/olbmxe/stressed_do_the_point_of_getting_sick/,0
Can stuff that’s good in your life actually cause stress?,"Such as my job which I’m quite proud of but can get busy some days and sometimes I feel like all I want is a break, my girlfriend who can nag me at times and sometimes we argue, my dog who I love but is very naughty in her puppy stage, the house which needs a lot of work including having to do diy with my partners dad (I don’t know anything about diy) and chores, money which is a bit tight atm but I am not really on a budget, a wedding coming up that I’m nervous about and it’s costing a fortune.

"I'm very stressed and I know why, but what can I do about it? Please help me","I'm a 21 year old man. Right now I have summer break, but I still feel as if I'm always working 24/7. I never enjoy anything in life (I'm also depressed and I have many mental issues) and I'm always tired and unmotivated about everything. And every single day feels as a heavy work day, even if I am at home having ""free"" time.

There are 2 reasons of my high stress. Reason 1 is being an unhappy single and reason 2 is trying so hard to find someone, which costs alot of effort and time. Before you read this, I am NOT here for dating advice, so please dont, unless you have a magic trick that will 100% sure work for ME. Since 4 years ago when I was 17, I started developing interest in girls. Now, 21, I still never had a relationship, but even worse, I never had a date or even a female friend even though I have tried different strategies which I failed. I never hugged a girl either. I have exactly 0 experience with girls. Why am I so stressed? It is because those 4 years, first of all: being single makes me unhappy. And second: I have been trying very hard to find a girl, to get the first date in my life or to even make a female friend. Every single day I waste my time on ~~dating~~ i mean ENDLESS SWIPING apps. (read: neverending swiping but never getting a match), asking on reddit how to get a girlfriend, asking google how to get a girlfriend, thinking about being single forever, you know what I mean. I waste alot of my time and energy in doing research about how to find a girlfriend but trust me, I have really tried going outside and trying out dating apps, I really tried stuff too. Nothing works.

So how can I feel less stressed? 1. Find the love of my life and be happy, but this won't happen any time soon, it seems impossible. So what can I do to get my mind off the impossible? I really have hobbies and interests, I have a life so that's not the problem here. The only missing part in my happiness is having a girlfriend. I feel very frustrated and tired and stressed and im starting to hate life. Seeing guys getting girlfriends as if it's the easiest thing in the world just makes me angry. These days even 10 year old kids have relationships. I guess my purpose on earth is just to be a loser.

I am so obsessed with dating and trying everything that I have no more focus on anything else in my life. I dont care about family anymore, I dont care about my friends anymore, I dont care about my hobbies anymore, I dont care about study anymore, I dont care about anything except I just want a girlfriend.

How can I be happy without having a partner? Really, I have study, I have a great family, I have friends, I have a hobby, my life is fine. Except for being girlfriend-deprived which really bothers me alot. It seems impossible to focus on anything else than how to get a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to feel more happy and relaxed and stop hating life? Whenever I play videogames or do whatever to relax and try to enjoy, it doesnt really make me happy because my frustration of being single and fear or being single forever, stays in the background of my thoughts no matter what i'm doing or focusing on. And whenever I try to relax or study or do anything, I feel guilty towards my dating life, thinking if i don't take action I will never find a partner

What should I do to feel happy and not frustrated and stressed??? Am I asking for the impossible here? Because honestly I thikn there is no way I can be happy without a partner. I just have this desire, and it's really strong and it's growing stronger. I can't just remove my desire, can I?

[video of conference talk] Stress &amp; Depression – a Taboo in our Time • Gitte Klitgaard • GOTO 2017,"Stress and stress-induced depression hit many knowledge workers, and yet it is still a taboo. “I am stressed” has become something we hear every day, and it has almost become prestigious to say so; it shows that we are busy, important people. On the other hand, it is a bit embarrassing to be really stressed and not being able to handle it.

The sad thing is that when it comes to the people, who are really stressed, we don’t hear it. We do not see it; we do not talk about it.

We feel awkward when people are stressed or come back from sick leave. We try not to talk about it. It is so much easier with a broken leg; we can carry stuff for them, hold the door, get coffee etc., but what do we do with a person with stress?

I have been sick with stress and it took nine months to come back. It was the second time and it had to hit me hard before I took it seriously.

I believe strongly in taking openly about stress and depression. It is the only way we can learn from it; the way we can make it okay to say “I need help!”.

In this talk I will discuss the taboo and explore why it hits knowledge workers so often, as well as come with tips and trick to prevent it.

When does stress become a “disability” or can it? Help/Advice welcome,"Hi there, I am brand new to this sub. I honestly searched Reddit for a stress sub bc I don’t know who else to ask (short of going to my doctor - which I’m not sure is warranted). I have been out of work throughout the pandemic and while it carried its own type of stressors I noticed after awhile that I had little to no heat burn, rarely experienced migraines anymore, and even my asthma seemed to subside. I have surmised that they were all in someway triggered by stress/anxiety. Of course I have been searching for a new job but out of fear from the pandemic I wasn’t in desperation mode. Now over a year out it just seems like time and I’ve been more heartily searching. I have multiple interviews coming up and while I haven’t consciously stressed over it, but I have noticed that I have been experiencing indigestion and last night I had the worst migraine of my life. Pandemic aside, I have enjoyed my free time over this last year and after last night I’m afraid to go back to that level of stress. Anyone have any suggestions? Should I talk to my doctor?

Paying close attention to your morning coffee can help you start your day with happiness,"We’re told that if we want to be happy, we need to exist in the present moment - but what does that actually mean?

One helpful way to think about it is living through your senses - what you can perceive right now. As humans we have many senses (a lot more than five!) and we can use these to pull us back from worries about the future and regrets from the past. Take drinking a cup of tea or coffee as an example. We can:


 -  Listen to the kettle boiling


 - Look at the colour if the drink and the mug that its in - you’ve probably seen it 1000 times but you can look at it with beginners mind as if you’ve never seen it before


 - Feeling the warmth of the cup in your hands


 - Smelling the tea before you drink it


 - Noticing the taste / flavour


 - Feeling it pass down our throat



There are many more perceptions for us to focus on. By tuning in to these we ground ourselves in the present moment, we calm ourselves and we can draw happiness from our everyday lives. Applying this awareness to your morning tea or coffee is an easy way to start to integrate awareness of the here and now into your life.

Kind of family,"I don't know if this is stress or more built up anger. My dad and mom got divorced many years ago when I was kind of young. My dad started dating about 2 or 3 years later and his gf was pretty nice, I was still pretty young so I didn't really like her but I look back now and she was pretty nice. They broke up about 3 years later and a couple years later he started dating somebody again. They've been dating for 3 years now maybe, at first I didn't really care but I'm older now so I have more emotions and she just moved in and I hate to say this, but I really don't like her at all, she's not mean or toxic or anything but she acts like a 5 year old everyday and never takes no for an answer. ""You want to go on a walk"" ""no"" then she bugs me for 15 minutes trying to get me to go on a walk when I don't like walks and have said no plenty of times. There are many other things that I don't like but she can also kind of be a bitch, I just went on a vacation for a week with my dad, her and her family and it's the last day, we're about to drive out. We have a dog so we put a cover on the back and when we got in to drive we realized it was backwards so I couldn't buckle, she looked back and said, ""you know Adam some things are important and you need to realize"", I said ""I know""
And then she kept going on a rant while I fixed it and the urge to tell her to stfu almost went above my limit, I have never told anyone to stfu or really shut up but it's been two days in a row where I almost told her to stfu. I'm thinking about getting a stress ball because she really makes me pissed, more and more recently since she's working from home and is always around so I could get a stress ball to get the anger out. If anybody has some other tips or stuff can you please help 
PS, my dad knows I don't like her, my brother who is going to college doesn't like her and knows I don't and I have no idea if she knows I don't like her because she can't take a hint that I don't like walks, don't like her, etc. Thanks in advance and sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit",AdamDennxxx,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/ohken3/kind_of_family/,0

I did this a month in advance and I help her to get a replacement for the other 20 hours I wasn't going to work. The week I return to school she didn't change my schedule and i confronted her and she said that she can't change the schedule. I was understanding and I suck it up and fuck my sleep because I knew she was having a hard time. I just tell her that next week I better get my schedule right and she said that I am good employee and wanted to make me assistant manager because everyone in this place have the IQ of someone who is brain damage. Therefore, she went on telling me that she didn't want me to quit. Guess what she fuck my schedule I was pretty clear no more than 20 hours ( two 10 hours shift thats how we did it)

Our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life.,"

 Being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe.

Did he just say infinite?
Yes, and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being, point of view, and mental state.

Child hood traumas, events that happened or even words that were said a long time ago, can hurt and carry through into our adulthood. Robbing us of our aliveness and spontaneity.
 
There is a tendency to store the energy of an unresolved trauma by locking it in the body. Even if the situation happened only once, an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field, causing tension, stress and possibly disease

Releasing this stored, suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy, natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive. 

One simple method to release this energy is by clearing it from your meridians (channels through which flows energy)((Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force.))

If you are interested into doing this free and simple method here's a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/_VUnuM82qd4) for you.

And here's my Reddit community r/spiritualchills where you can share your own experiences, talk and ask questions about your spiritual energy.",KundalinirRZA,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/of1x23/our_conscious_awareness_is_one_of_our_most/,0
Feeling stuck,"Feeling I’m stuck in both my work and personal life. 

I have a well paid but stressful job. In the first a few years, I voluntarily worked hard for a faster promotion and a better pay. After some successful projects, however, I don’t see a very clear goal. I’d always wanted to move to a management role, but there is no opening. So, I need to continue my current role that has gradually become repetitive for me. Without a clear motivation, the high work load easily turns me into a burnout mode.

My relationship with my partner is complicated as well. After spending many years together and going through some very tough periods, the relationship is more or less stable but I can clearly feel the anxiety to be with my partner sometimes, as the goal is just to go through the day without irritating each other.

How to calm the body down?,"Does anyone find their body flares up in a stress response at any kind of deviation from equilibrium?

I just don’t know how to calm it down. 

I do yoga, I journal, I nap if I feel I need to, I try to say no to social events I don’t really want to go to, I take Xanax as and when I need - I mostly just ride it out and try and take care of myself but sometimes these symptoms get in the way of things I need to do!

"If you struggle to deal with difficult emotions, you're not alone - it might seem like other people are in control / take everything in stride but they're suffering and muddling through as well","When I was in my twenties, which is a long time ago now, I often felt that I was a child pretending to be an adult. I looked around at other people my age and they all seemed to have their lives together and I felt like the only clueless person, the only one who felt lost.

Then I got a bit older and realised that almost everyone feels this way, everyone is muddling through the best they can, they don’t have a grand plan, they don’t have everything sorted out. Even as older adults we can still feel like this sometimes when things are overwhelming us, we can feel like we’re the only person who can’t cope.

Its easy to see why we make this error. We are aware of all of our difficult thoughts and feelings but not of others people’s and vice versa - people will look at you and think that you are more sorted out than them even though we would look at all of our neuroses and see an intractable mess, like a big pile of spaghetti. But self reflection and meditation can help to sort out our spaghetti over time with regular practice.

The first thing to say is to pick the time and place for introspection. If you’re having a really tough time and feeling overwhelmed it’s best to focus on basic meditation practice  - breath, body, calm ease, mindful walking. When the storm is really blowing the fundamentals are your friend, you can wait for calmer times to do some self-reflection.

A good time for self reflection is when you feel an emotion arising like fear or anger. One of the key insights is that we don’t have to be a vehicle for these emotions, we can instead view ourselves as a conscious being that is experiencing sadness, joy, fear. In that way we can break the link between difficult emotions and automatic behaviours and instead allow ourselves to fully experience and accept what we’re feeling.

When we’ve spent some time breathing and being present with the emotion we can ask ourselves questions to understand why we’re feeling the way we are and prevent difficult feelings from developing into suffering. So we might ask:
* What are the immediate circumstances which are triggering these feelings? 
* What are the wider circumstances that are feeling into it? e.g. lack of sleep
* What are the thoughts I’m having around these circumstances? This might seem obvious but we’re frequently not aware of the thoughts we’re having when we have difficult feelings.
* What past experiences reflect what’s happening now?
* What assumptions and beliefs were formed from those experiences that are informing my reaction?
* Finally, how does my emotional reaction reflect the experiences of previous generations?

In short it’s drawing a line from our arising emotion all the way back through our lives and beyond to gain insight into our suffering. By gaining understanding we can be more accepting of our experience and let go of difficult feelings rather than holding onto them. Meditating on the emotion is a helpful approach. Breathing in, I am aware of my anger. Breathing out, I smile to my anger. Breathing in, I see the roots of my anger. Breathing out, I smile to the roots of my anger.

Ultimately we need to be kind to ourselves, to treat our feelings and suffering with compassion because its not helpful to blame ourselves for our reactions. Everyone is doing the best they can given their circumstances (including you) so be kind to yourself and be kind to your spaghetti.

I’m worried I’m going to disappoint my family,"I don’t really know where to turn and I’m running out of options. I’m in Med school, abroad, and am embroiled in trying to earn a few more points on a major exam so that I can attend my sister’s wedding, which is to be held in the States. The exam I failed has a make up, but it is literally scheduled the day after the wedding, so to travel back abroad still means I would have to miss out on the occasion, which itself can’t be delayed any further. I know that I am not the strongest of students, but I really felt confident with the particular exam, and now because of my own damn fault I may be withheld from going. I just feel like I’m letting everyone down, like I’m just destined to keep failing. It’s hard to talk to people close to me on this matter, despite me doing so, because it just goes back into this loop of “you did this to yourself, you need to dedicate more time to studying, etc.” I don’t disagree with the feedback, but it’s not helping me right now. I just feel trapped.

Update: well, I tried. I went to the University office, and it was such a farce. They stopped any conversation saying “Their hands are tied,” or “we are legally bound from doing ...”, including providing the answer key to said exam so that I could see where the points were lost. I won’t be attending my sister’s wedding, and will have to sit in for the make up exam. I never minded sitting for the exam, it’s just the timing of it all. I could go on about how pathetic the scheduling system is, how I can’t even access the exam admit card until a few days prior to the exam, but it’s not going to do me any good.

I want to cry. I feel like the dumbest person in the world.,"I’m 25 and currently taking a college precalculus course at community college so that I can have a better future. I grew up poor and getting a good education is a way for me to break free from poverty. I’ve been acing all my classes up until this class which I currently have an 89% in but I have a feeling it might drop significantly due to the fact that I don’t understand the 2 chapters that we were taught. I have a 2 chapter exam and a finals back to back in 12 days since this class is a summer math course and is only 4 weeks. 

We are currently learning matrices and I just don’t get it no matter how hard I try. We were supposed to be taught how to do this since middle school and high school algebra but of course I went to a pretty bad school and was never taught how to do basic row echelon forms. I feel so left behind compared to the rest of my class. Everyday I study for more than 5 hours and I just cannot pick things up. I go to tutoring sessions, ask professors and students for help and I just can’t understand this chapter. I’ve tried YouTube videos and even performing problems on my own, but it just causes this overwhelming feeling in my brain which I cannot really describe. 

I wake up at 5am to prepare for this class on top of going to work. My parents are very stressed and tired and I just want to excel in school, make them proud, and take care of them in the future. Right now, I am so scared my GPA will drop since I want to transfer into a good school.

"Stressed, but for no reason?","Hi there!  I was wondering if anyone may have some wise words, or advice on how I could possibly manage chronic stress, when I have it for no reason!

I seem to have all the symptoms; I can't sleep more than 5 hours a night, and wake up constantly, I have a ""stress belly"", I feel anxious often, and I am forgetful. I feel I am also exhausted when it comes to relationships, zero sex drive and often feel anxious.

However... I can't understand why? I am pretty lucky in my life, and have a roof over my head, good friends and food in my fridge. I exercise a moderate amount, eat a healthy diet with lots of fruit and veggies, and I am pretty good at getting a work-life balance (I think!). I have hobbies I enjoy, and spend time socialising, and I am not really stressed out with university or work.

However I just feel like there is a constant stress in my stomach.

So does anyone have any idea of where I am going wrong... or if there is anything I can do?

Can’t fall asleep before another 11 hour shift.,"The title says it all. My body is now always in alert mode, even when I try to dial down. It is the end of 3AM and I have to be back there at 6am, until either 5 or 6 PM in a humid laborious position where there is no sitting, only go do this, go cut this, climb up these stairs 4 dozen times to clean these pipes. Covid and it’s lack of employees in places caused this 8 hour job to be turned into a 12 hour rut for the existing staff, and now I wonder why I am doing what I’m doing. I needed money so that is my fault, but although I am relatively athletic and my body is turning cut and defined, I feel exhaustion and sadness about giving 12 hours of my day to this place.

They know that people are easily led and will do things and believe things if they get the impression that lots of other people are doing those things and believing those things. That axiom even applies to using twitter. Poetically, their final act of manipulation for this act might ultimately be one of self destruction. In an attempt to cover their asses and hide the fact that follower counts and like counts have been highly manipulated for years, they are currently in the process of deleting perhaps millions of bots over the next few weeks or months.",hillbillyswan,51,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/uc2zwd/twitter_is_purging_bots_used_to_manufacture/,0

Something about Shanghai rubs me the wrong way.,"At the onset of the pandemic and continuing onwards, China was extremely tight-lipped about their numbers. They restricted domestic travel, but not international. Lockdowns were enacted, then lifted. With each variant of Covid it has gained in virility, but lost in lethality. These facts combined presents a perplexing situation in Shanghai. Why starve millions of people, keep them locked up for more than a month, kill their animals, all the while dealing a massive blow to yourself economically, for a virus that supposedly isn't that big a threat anymore? And why now, has all this footage and testimonies been able to reach the rest of the world?",GamegodWXP,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ucbfmn/something_about_shanghai_rubs_me_the_wrong_way/,0
The real reason for women's mental health decline in the modern era that no one is allowed to talk about: Birth Control Pills.,"Women's mental health has been declining exponentially since the 60's. Today, women attempt suicide at 3x the rate of men (albeit, actual successful suicide rate is much higher among men)  Anyone who have female friends will know that a majority of them are unstable, much too emotional, and on some form of drugs to counter their mental illness.  But why?

Why does no one ever ask WHY the female mental health is so poor when the answer is so blatantly clear and in the open?  It's birth control pills, stupid.

Research after research is showing just how important hormones are to mental health. A quick web search will show you just how profound the effects are. Hormones control every aspect of our body. There's literally no bodily function that does not rely on hormones for messaging. And our brains rely heavily on hormones.  If you mess with hormones, you mess with your brain. It's as simple as that. [http://usm.ncu.edu.jm/the-relationship-between-hormones-and-mental-health/](http://usm.ncu.edu.jm/the-relationship-between-hormones-and-mental-health/) Taking birth control pills is messing up your brain. Plain and simple.

But then why does no one question the use of birth control pills?  Let's look at some stats. As of 2019, 922 million women world wide were taking birth control pills. Given the world's population of nearly 4 billion women, that's almost a 1/4 of women on the pill.  And the concentration of those on the pill are incredibly centered on western civilizations like the US and Europe.  [https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/contraceptive-pills-market-101802](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/contraceptive-pills-market-101802)

This means that probably between 30% to 50% of all women you know are taking birth control pills. Yes, including teenagers.  

It's very hard to research the market value of birth control pills but some of the estimates places it at $5 to $6 billion per year. The pharmaceutical companies keep the data secret. And I think we all can guess why they do so.

So how are they able to this?  How are they able to hide the dinosaur sized elephant in the room under the radar? I mean, when was the last time you saw an article or a news story on the side effects of the pill?  Never perhaps?

The answer is Feminism.  You see, anytime you question the safety of the birth control pills, you get called misogynist or sexist for the ""pill"" is what empowers women. It's what makes the women have the sexual freedom that men enjoy. We've been fed this since the invention of the pill which was approved by the FDA on June 23, 1960.  Do you think it's just a coincidence that women's mental health has been declining on an exact trajectory as the adoption of birth control pills by women?  If you overlay the 2 graphs of women taking the pill vs mental illness in women, it is IDENTICAL.  Who do you think pushed the sexual freedom narrative as feminism? As if sleeping with a thousand guys has ANYTHING to do with women's rights and freedom.  As if having sex will somehow get you an education or a high paying job or the right to vote?  Who pushed this nonsense?  Of course, it was the pharmaceutical industry.  Do you think it was a coincidence that 2nd wave feminism started EXACTLY at the same time that the birth control pill was approved for use?

$6 billion a year is a lot of money. And it is projected to only grow in the coming years. It is no wonder they are pushing the feminism narrative.  They are sacrificing women for profit. And women just eat it up.  Women need to wake up to this veil that has been placed over them.  They need to see what's happening to them. And the situation is only getting worse. Even though we know that hormones have a profound effect on the brain, we are now encouraging hormonal blockers on adolescents who have gender dysphoria.  It is a death sentence for them.  They will never get better or happy. Their lives will be forever miserable ending in tragedy.",psy_raven,596,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ublxu5/the_real_reason_for_womens_mental_health_decline/,0

we already have the solution to this world problem.,"Once a problem is identified it can be understood, and then fixed.

Our problem is a small group of us have tricked most of us.

Imagine for a moment that its lunchtime at school. A few of the kids devise a game where they trickle bits of energy from as many sources as they can so they end up with all the power and making all the choices. Do you still want to play? 

So we know for a fact there is a group that;
- fakes elections in France and everywhere in the world
- creates biological weapons to release into the populace
- infiltrates all our sources of information and changes the info to suit their imagined history. 

The list could go on.

Essentially everything you would need to understand your own reality has something attached to it which distorts the truth. We get it.

So how about we dont play with these kids at lunch anymore?

Identify every actor, politician, corporate shill and stop giving them your energy.

Change our voting systems. It should be pretty obvious to everyone this isnt working. And dont wait for ""next election"" how stupid are we to allow the term to finish. This needs to be dealt with NOW. Before the food shortages and electrical blackouts because putin.


Why are we sitting around waiting to starve because they have decided this is the way?

I dont care if this is a plan to control everyone through brain nanobots, or the rose cross georgia guidstone people want to lower the population, or the annunaki are coming and they have been told to coral us all up. I dont care. Im not into it.

Theres also the metaphysical conspiracies, and those dont matter to me at all.
 So  what if there is some big thousands of years cycle, and America is the new atlantis. You want to tell me that theres some 6000 year plan and consciusness can alter physical reality so theres satanism everywhere and some assholes have infiltrated every religion and university and culture? Go ahead, thats fine with me tbh. 

I know what my values are and what i strive for. I know how im going to feel if i see someone hurt someone else. This is known to me.

I want to have kids and BUILD my house and get better at classical guitar  because its hard and read a bunch of books and go fishing and shit.

Find your own values if you havent thought about it and ask of thats the direction the world is trying to take you.

We can just talk to eachother. Theres enough of us to hive mind this stuff into existence.

We have social networks. Lets start a movement and reach everyone worldwide to start our own currency system. Obviously the powers that be have their scaley claws in digital currency, so we will have to further identify where they can mess it up for us and fix it.


We can keep patching the boat.

Gaslighting 101,"This war in the Ukraine is just not lining up with the terror and carnage that they are portraying. I want you to look at the photos that they are using to stir emotions in their attempt to gaslight you. 

Bottomline up front (BLUF): I have spent 24 years in the US military with 6 of those in real warzones. The invasion is real, but it isn't what we are being told. They are showing demolished buildings with clean up dumpsters immediately. In a country where the civilians have largely left, why are they all walking around and cleaning up debris? My experience in Europe is that all of the governments move like pondwater. Getting a construction bin in peacetime is a monumental task. Also, 90% of the photos have a great deal of civilian onlookers. These are humanitarian efforts to help ease resistance to Russia taking over. I believe that the war is all but over, but Zelensky doesn't want to lose because when he loses his power, Putin will kill him. 

I know that people are concerned about refugees. That is why TPTB opened world borders to accept them years ago. It is dramatically apparent in the Ukraine war. There are obviously people that don't want to live under Russian rule, but they will be rewarded for their silence by giving them citizenship to the country of their choice with free money, phones and all of the necessities to acclimate to their new countries. It makes you rethink the 1.7 trillion USD in community outreach programs. I will add more links later.

TPTB needs the general population to be weak for their next step in their totalitarian takeover,"It's not gonna be too short, not too long - but hear me here, I think this is pretty legit.

Some of what we have witnessed in the last two years:

1. A virus which came out of nowhere, was proved by multiple Virologists to be man-made, lab-created, caused millions of people to get sick and some even died.
2. Lockdowns, Business closures, totalitarian measures such as mask mandates, social distancing, police would look after people who forgot to wear their mask instead of chasing criminals etc..
3. Forced / Coerced jabs, which were proved to provide zero protection from said virus, and even worse, have created terrible life changing side effects, and more vaccine-induced death than any other vaccine in history.
4. Forced / Coerced ""booster"" jabs, more useless crap which had no effect or protection, and just made some people's already bad side-effects worse.

Now we have stuff like:

1. Man-made wars (Ukraine-Russia, strange foreign and unified support for only one side of the war even by a country which held complete neutrality when the Nazis murdered millions, ton of propaganda, false and doctored footage etc.. Military complex arms sales through the roof etc..)
2. Man-made, Orchestrated food-shortages: Countries paying farmers more money not to farm, and to destroy their crops, and sell their cattle. in some places farmers after forced not to farm a huge portion of their land at the excuse of ""environment conservation""..  an artificially created war is being used as an excuse for ""incoming food shortages"" even though the countries that are at war only produce two key ingredients, and also not exclusively - stuff that could also be grown elsewhere if the situation was really dire, governments limit amounts of fertilizer that farmers can buy, fertilizer prices gauged so that many smaller farms can not grow crops and close down etc..
3. Man-made energy crisis: all of this talk about climate change, and how oil is dirty.. and why we should ditch it and focus in one single source of energy from solar and wind etc... instead of having redundancy of different sources etc..  energy price gauging etc..

All of this stuff was created, in order to destroy the general population's spirits, destroy them financially, socially, make them sick, weak, stressed, mindless = unable to resist,easier to control = guaranteed compliance.

TPTB want the world's general population as weak as possible, in order to execute their next steps in their evil dystopian technocratic plan (Agenda 2021, Agenda 2030, WEF ""You will own nothing"" etc..)

I think that the only way out of this, is trying to stay strong - TPTB know that a weak population could not fight against what they plan ahead, but if people are fit - there will be a fight. TPTB are trying to avoid that by pretty much smashing people's down with their boot, in all types of techniques.

# John Durham Issues Trial Subpoenas to Members of Clinton Campaign, DNC

By Katabella Roberts April 25, 2022 Updated: April 26, 2022biggersmaller [Print](https://www.theepochtimes.com/john-durham-issues-trial-subpoenas-to-members-of-clinton-campaign-dnc_4424881.html?utm_source=mr_recommendation&amp;utm_medium=left_sticky#Print)0:005:551 [Feedback](mailto:audio@epochtimes.com)Share

Special counsel John Durham has issued trial subpoenas for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Fusion GPS, and Perkins Coie as he continues to prosecute his findings as special counsel, from which he charged cybersecurity lawyer Michael Sussmann, who in 2016 represented the Clinton campaign, with lying to the FBI.

Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, the DNC, Washington-based private intelligence firm Fusion GPS, and law firm Perkins Coie, Sussmann’s former employer, meanwhile, are trying to fend off Durham’s efforts to compel them to hand over previously withheld documents.

The campaign and Sussmann’s lawyers argue that attorney-client privilege should allow them to keep the [records concealed](https://www.theepochtimes.com/former-dni-classified-documents-will-blow-john-durham-case-wide-open_4424041.html).

Durham, who was tasked around March-May 2019 with reviewing the origins of the 2016-2017 FBI investigation of the now disproven Trump–Russia collusion narrative, says his investigation has led him to believe that the Clinton-allied groups played a coordinating role in pushing the false claims.

In May 2017, special counsel and former FBI head Robert Mueller ultimately found no Trump-Russia collusion to sway the 2016 election.

Earlier this month, Durham [said](https://www.theepochtimes.com/hillary-clintons-campaign-moves-to-intervene-in-case-brought-by-john-durham_4415796.html?utm_source=ai&amp;utm_medium=search) that Fusion GPS “was not primarily providing or supporting expertise relating to legal advice; instead, it appears that the investigative firm’s primary, if not sole, function was to generate opposition research materials that the firm then shared widely.”

On April 23, Durham said of the groups, “meeting to agree on the express goal of a joint venture is precisely what happened here, on more than one occasion.”

The special counsel said that “Tech Executive-1” Rodney Joffe, “Originator-1” April Lorenzen of the information services firm Zetalytics, and other researchers started to discuss “searching for and collecting derogatory internet data about the online activities of Donald Trump and his associates” in June 2016.

Lorenzen “assembled and shared initial purported data” with Joffe, “who, in turn, shared the data” with Sussmann, Durham added.

“The joint venture continued and crystallized early in August 2016,” when Sussmann, Joffe, and “agents of the [Clinton Campaign](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-clinton-campaign)” met, Durham said, while citing an Aug. 12, 2016, meeting where Sussmann, Joffe, Marc Elias (former Perkins Coie partner), and the co-founder of Fusion gathered in Elias’s office to discuss “the same Russian Bank-1 allegations that the defendant would later bring to the FBI.”

“The parties agreed to conduct work in the hope that it would benefit the Clinton Campaign, namely, gathering and disseminating purportedly derogatory data regarding Trump and his associates’ internet activities,” Durham wrote.

“The evidence will show that as a result of these conversations and during this same time period, Tech Executive-1 did exactly that: he tasked employees from multiple Internet companies and a university working under a pending national security contract to mine and gather vast amounts of internet metadata in order to support an ‘inference’ and ‘narrative’ tying the candidate \[Trump\] to Russia.”

Durham went on to add that Joffe continued the “joint venture” via an Aug. 17, 2016, call with Sussmann and Elias, an Aug. 19, 2016, meeting with Sussmann and Elias, and a Sept. 8, 2016, call and meeting with Sussmann.

All of these, Durham said, citing calendars he has viewed, were billed to the Clinton Campaign by the defendant.

Durham further stated that Joffe also requested the CEO of an internet company to mine and analyze huge amounts of internet traffic for derogatory information regarding Trump and his associate’s online communications and internet connections.

Joffe also sent the CEO of the internet company a list containing private information, such as email addresses, IP addresses, and physical addresses of multiple Trump associates, many of whom were being researched by Fusion, Durham said.

Joffe had made clear his desire to ensure that Perkins and the Clinton campaign would be “happy” with the information he had discovered, Durham added.

Sussman was indicted in September 2021 for lying to the FBI when he claimed he had information about an alleged secret communication channel between Trump and a Russian bank; claims which ultimately proved to be false.

Sussman allegedly told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in October 2016, while making the claims of alleged communications, that he was not representing any client, while he, in fact, was billing the time to the Clinton campaign.

Following the subpoenas, lawyers for Sussman moved to prevent materials being admitted in the case with their argument that they are protected by attorney-client privilege. They’ve called Durham’s subpoenas “astonishing and legally inappropriate.”

“The Special Counsel continues to overreach: he seeks to admit evidence that the law squarely forbids, he seeks to prove unduly prejudicial allegations he has not charged, and he seeks to prove conduct that is utterly irrelevant to the one discrete crime he has charged,” the lawyers said.

Durham disputes that.

He maintains that “the goal of the joint venture could not have been more clear: it was to gather and disseminate derogatory non-public information regarding the internet activities of a political candidate and his associates,” he wrote in a April 23 court filing.",Historical_Tour_5841,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ucggef/article_in_epoch_times/,0

"The ""Vaccines"" &amp; Cancer - A Connection?","There has been some talk about an increase in cancer cases since the rollout of the vaccines and the mandates.

We can't say anything for certain, but I've heard of enough stories from friends and relatives, not to mention my own experiences, which make me think that the mRNA shots are at least heavily correlated with the uptick in cancers in people.

I remain happily unvaxxed, and I am fiercely anti-mandate.  The level of anger and rage that I've felt at the Left and all the jab pushers the last few months has been incredibly high, but still, I don't wish harm upon anyone.

One anecdote I have is that an old friend of mine gave me this long email lecture many months ago about how wrong I was about not getting the vaxx, and then said individual proceeded to go on a politically tinged rant that was somewhat out of character for him.

Anyway, months later - quite recently actually - I receive a frantic email from this same person saying that they are going into major cancer surgery and asked for prayers.

I felt pretty bad, as this person had no history with cancer before, as far as I know.  But the fact that he came down with something like this after 3 shots just doesn't seem like a coincidence.

As mentioned before ,I've been hearing many similar stories here and there about people suddenly coming down with some form of cancer.

"A US/China bioweapon virus is unleashed, it's extremely contagious, we have no natural immunity, it's so stealthy you need a test to know if you have it, it's only gotten more contagious and less likely to cause symptoms, we still don't know the long term effects, and people here are fine getting it","Pepperidge Farm remembers when covid was purposefully released by the Chinese as a bioweapon virus attack on the rest of the world.

Somehow covid got a makeover, did a complete 180, and is now considered harmless and people here are proud to announce they have natural immunity so they don't need to worry. I am absolutely astonished that I don't see any posts, at least not front page or top comments, talking about the possibility that covid caused any of the health issues that are popping up all over now.

Non stop I see everybody saying that people who got vaccinated can't back down now, admit they were tricked, and accept their choices might have caused their own health issues. I'm beginning to wonder if that same effect is happening here too. 

It's almost like conspiracies are actively guided away from blaming covid. Like there was pro covid propaganda here just as there was pro vaccine propaganda elsewhere. 

No part of me is saying the vaccines are safe/effective or that we know they're not causing all the health issues/deaths. I'm saying that covid should be treated more like the vaccine. At least with the vaccine you need to actively seek it out. You're not at risk of strangers injecting with the vaccines while grocery shopping but they can easily spread covid and infect you. You're not getting vaccinated without knowing it. We don't know the long term effects of neither the vaccine nor covid, both could easily cause unknown issues down the road

People here seem very willing to ask if somebody was vaccinated on a post about somebodies death or health issues. Nobody dare ask if they had covid. Nobody dare mention that it's possible they had covid without even knowing.

Does anybody else find it strange that something most people still think is a bioweapon purposefully released from a chinese/US biolab is basically ignored and treated as if it's no big deal?",PAmmjTossaway,21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/uc3jig/a_uschina_bioweapon_virus_is_unleashed_its/,0

"Beijing’s Influence Group Seeks Partnership With State Agricultural Officials, After Teaming Up With Bill Gates for Years"," 

A number of U.S. government officials recently took part in a virtual agriculture event co-hosted by a Beijing-backed influence association that has ties to [Bill Gates](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-bill-gates).

The United States Heartland China Association (USHCA), a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization founded in 2003, held the online 2022 U.S.-China Agriculture Roundtable earlier this month. The online event was co-hosted by the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC).

The Trump administration warned about CPAFFC. In February 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, [called out](https://2017-2021.state.gov/u-s-states-and-the-china-competition/index.html) the association as “the public face of the Chinese Communist Party’s official foreign influence agency, the [United Front Work Department](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-united-front-work-department).”

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) uses the United Front Work Department (UFWD) to run its foreign influence operations. In the United States, the CCP has also deployed grass-roots level [“united front” groups](https://www.theepochtimes.com/chinese-regime-amping-up-united-front-efforts-to-influence-western-democracies-report_3382477.html) as part of its effort to infiltrate America’s civil and political institutions.

CPAFFC is “tasked with co-opting subnational governments” and “has sought to directly and malignly influence state and local leaders to promote the PRC’s \[People’s Republic of China\] global agenda,” the U.S. State Department [warned](https://2017-2021.state.gov/designation-of-the-national-association-for-chinas-peaceful-unification-nacpu-as-a-foreign-mission-of-the-prc/index.html) in October 2020, when [designating](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-designates-chinese-communist-party-front-group-as-foreign-mission_3557245.html) another group, a Washington-based Chinese organization, as a foreign mission.

The roundtable featured a number of U.S. state officials, including Oklahoma Secretary of Agriculture Blayne Arthur, Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Mike Beam, Missouri Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, and Rep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.)

The 2022 roundtable event was initially reported by the National Pulse. The inaugural roundtable was held in April 2021.

The state-run Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) was one of the partners of the event. Several CASS officials and scholars also took part in the roundtable, including Wang Wei, director-general of the academy’s bureau of international cooperation.

 Bob Holden, former Democrat governor of Missouri and current USHCA chairman and CEO, said during the roundtable’s opening ceremony that U.S.-Sino cooperation was “essential” to overcome global challenges, including “producing enough nutritious food to feed the growing population on the planet” and “preventing future pandemics of human, animal, and plant diseases.”

The online event comes at a time when China has been increasing its [purchases](https://www.theepochtimes.com/congressman-wants-to-end-chinas-buying-spree-on-american-farmland_4147512.html) of U.S. farmland in the last decade, prompting concerns about U.S. national security.

Meanwhile, Gates has also been a huge buyer of agricultural land in the United States. U.S. magazine Land Report [declared](https://landreport.com/2021/01/bill-gates-americas-top-farmland-owner/) that Gates was America’s largest private farmland owner in January 2021, saying his family had accumulated an estimated 242,000 acres of farmland.

Bill Gates

Microsoft founder Bill Gates has worked with CPAFFC over the years, in particular with the association’s previous president, Li Xiaolin, who held the position from September 2011 to April 2020.

Li is no ordinary Chinese citizen. She was a former member of the Chinese regime’s political advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Additionally, she is the daughter of former Chinese regime leader Li Xiannian and her husband is Liu Yazhou, a retired general of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force.

Gates and Li met face to face during the 2013 Global Vaccine Summit in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. According to CPAFFC’s website, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation invited Li to the summit, during which she took part in a panel speaking about China’s immunization efforts to eliminate polio.

In August 2013, the foundation [announced](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2013/08/reinvent-the-toilet-challenge-debuts-in-china) that it will invest $5 million to “support Chinese investigators to drive research, development, and production of the ‘next generation toilet,’” as part of its global “Reveint the Toilet Challenge.” According to the University of Science and Technology Beijing, a launch event in China was attended by Li, a China-based representative of the foundation, the university’s party secretary, and Chinese health officials.

Gates visited CPAFFC’s headquarters in China in June 2014, during which he gave a speech titled “Invent for the Poor.” According to a video on CPAFFC’s website, Gates praised the Chinese regime and the association in his speech.

“Here in China, it is fantastic to see the investment in engineering and medical technology, all sorts of things that China is assuming a very, very strong positioning,” Gates said.

He added, “And so our hope for the Friendship Association is that together we can find these great ideas in China and that we can find the right partners in Africa and elsewhere, who can take these new tools and use them on behalf of the people.”

 Mark Suzman, the foundation’s CEO, and Li both attended the World Philanthropy Forum held at China’s Tsinghua University in September 2016. According to China’s state-run media, Suzman applauded China for its “potential” in philanthropy works and its “unique role” in Africa’s development.

Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the foundation, held a meeting with Li in China in July 2017. According to CPAFFC’s website, French Gates praised CPAFFC for its philanthropic works. She also invited Li to join the End Malaria Council (EMC), which is an initiative launched in part by Gates in 2017.

Li subsequently participated in an EMC meeting held in Beijing in April 2019, according to CPAFFC.

Gates and Li also had connections through another United Front agency, the Hong Kong-based [China-United States Exchange Foundation](https://www.theepochtimes.com/three-warfares-doctrine-underpins-ccps-sprawling-campaign-to-infiltrate-the-west-report_4021847.html?utm_source=ai&amp;utm_medium=search) (CUSEF), which is managed by CPAFFC. CUSEF names Li as its vice-chairman on its website and its 2013 report names Gates as a member of its steering committee.

[CUSEF](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-linked-group-tries-to-sway-us-media-with-reporter-trips-dinners-with-execs_3653448.html?utm_source=ai&amp;utm_medium=search) is headed by Chinese regime official Tung Chee-hwa, a former Hong Kong leader and current vice-chairman of the CPPCC.

## CPAFFC

CPAFFC was established in 1954 and it has over 300 local branches throughout China. Outside of the Chinese borders, there are regional-level branches such as the Chinese-Arab Friendship Association, as well as country-level branches such as the China-U.S. People’s Friendship Association in the United States.

The current CPAFFC president is Lin Songtian, who took up the position in April 2020. Before then, he had been China’s ambassador to South Africa since 2017.

When Lin was in South Africa, Lin was an outspoken critic of the United States on Twitter. In March 2020, he amplified an unfounded conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 pandemic had originated from the U.S. military, when he retweeted a now notorious [post](https://www.theepochtimes.com/three-warfares-doctrine-underpins-ccps-sprawling-campaign-to-infiltrate-the-west-report_4021847.html?utm_source=ai&amp;utm_medium=search) by Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.

In response to Zhao’s accusations, the U.S. State Department [summoned](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-summons-chinese-ambassador-over-claims-that-wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak-came-from-us_3272268.html) China’s then-ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai.

In June 2020, Sen. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) released an interim report ([pdf](https://gop-foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Interim-Minority-Report-on-the-Origins-of-the-COVID-19-Global-Pandemic-Including-the-Roles-of-the-CCP-and-WHO-8.17.20.pdf)) on the origins of COVID-19. The report criticized the Chinese regime, saying that the pandemic “could have been prevented” if Chinese officials had responded to the initial outbreaks in a “transparent and responsible manner.”

A month later, Lin wrote in a tweet that the interim report was intended to “shift blames and cover the delinquency of #Trump Administration.”

Lin also took to Twitter repeatedly to defend the communist regime’s policies targeting ethnic minorities in far-western region of Xinjiang. In a tweet in December 2019, he said China’s “vocational education and training centers,” which Western officials have described as “[concentration camps](https://www.theepochtimes.com/china-putting-minority-muslims-in-concentration-camps-us-says_2908698.html),” were effective in ending “extremism” in Xinjiang.

China has used “combating extremism” as a pretext to lock up over 1 million Uyghurs in Xinjiang, while subjecting them to forced sterilization, forced labor, and other inhumane treatment. Both the [Trump](https://www.theepochtimes.com/trump-admin-declares-beijings-repression-in-xinjiang-a-genocide_3662785.html) and [Biden](https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/biden-says-ccp-oppression-of-uyghurs-is-genocide-agrees-with-trump-admin-designation_3669674.html) administrations have determined that China has committed “[genocide](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-genocide)” and “crimes against humanity” against Uyghurs.

 At the opening ceremony of the April roundtable, Lin said that China and the United States should work together because the two sides “complement each other.” According to Lin, the United States has the advantage of having advanced technology, finance, and talent, while China possesses a large market and high domestic demand.

The Epoch Times has reached out to USHCA and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for comments.

The activities of Chinese influence groups in Italy, including CPAFFC, were the focus of a [2021 report](https://www.theepochtimes.com/report-exposes-chinese-influence-in-italian-politics_4132397.html) by researchers at Sinopsis, a project by non-profit AcaMedia z.u., in collaboration with the Department of Sinology at Charles University in Prague.

The report told government bodies, politicians, and political parties to “avoid interactions” with CPAFFC and other CCP influence agencies.

“The activities of these agencies and their fronts by-pass norms that require accountability of state-to-state relationships, disguising the party-state’s activities through ‘people-to-people,’ ‘cultural,’ ‘non-government’ or other labels,” the report stated.

“Legislators should understand the nature of cooption and propaganda events to which they are invited as influence tools, rather than ‘dialogue’ partners,” the report added.

“Even attending them to express critical views allows the CCP to publicly present its interlocutors as endorsers of its platforms and narratives.”

Why the rich don’t pay taxes.,"People really believe that the 1% “cheat” the system and get away with not paying taxes, and that is the sole reason why our economy is trash. They think the rich use loopholes and “unethical” methods to “cheat” the government. However, this couldn’t be much further from the truth. 

The government’s tax system is specifically designed so that corporations don’t have to pay tax. Entrepreneur’s create jobs, and stimulate the economy. If you tax them heavily they’ll have less money to grow, therefore have less ability to impact the economy. 

The government knows that wealthy people can stimulate the economy MUCH better than they can, so they don’t tax them. 

This is such a simple concept to understand, yet many people blame capitalism and the “rich” and accuse them of cheating the system, when the system was specifically designed to give corporations as many opportunities to grow. 

It’s honestly so simple to understand basic tax fundamentals that can save you thousands of dollars from taxes, but people just don’t care enough or want to put in the effort to learn. 


TLDR; The government created the tax system to stimulate growth for the economy by not taxing the rich, and heavily taxing the poor. Every new rule that supposedly taxes the rich, affects the poor much harder.",Naive-Introduction58,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ucgnsl/why_the_rich_dont_pay_taxes/,0

Rep. John Thompson of Minnesota is an intelligence asset deliberately placed in that position to sow discord and racial (anti-police) strife with a series of completely bizarre meltdowns with law officials and political opponents.,"If you are ""elite"" scum you revel in the masses at each others' throats. With this character staging astronomically stupid and seemingly deliberate actions that have been hyper-lightening rods in what's normally a relatively quiet state you see an undeniable trend now.

That's why it sticks out so much. Rep John is not even from MN and his spooked-out handlers are not as well.

If you are from MN you will know exactly what I'm referring to here. This dude is off the charts in his agitation actions and no matter who denounces him or how far he goes with his antics NOTHING happens to him, he just keeps doing horrible shit that makes NO sense other than to DELIBERATELY maintain the anti-police, racial strife narrative that one COULD argue has been artificially propped up by actors like this. He's like a drunk wife running at her husband swinging her fists hoping that she gets a bruise so she can nail her husband to the wall. That's the anti-police move here imo. And it's deliberately being staged for reasons.

ALL these weird police/criminal-fleeing type of deaths with POCs literally NEVER happened in MSP before. The onslaught of 6-7 events all of a sudden just HAPPENED like skits (that incidentally made almost NO sense).

One could argue that much of it seemed either fake or contrived using one of a litany of ways you could pull it off. One, the could be mental patients under MK. George Floyds behavior from step one of passing bad bills to step fifty of kicking and fighting with police literally ignoring every possible command to keep him safe until Mpls/St Paul is burning down in riots.

The Castile case, the Wright case, the BCA one in uptown - they ALL carry the same type of inexplainable actions that on paper are not only non-sensical but happened within a short time frame with almost NOTHING like this happening in this state EVER prior.

This nut Rep. John Thompson has done so many stupid things that his own party's state leader (the Gov) denounced him and pleaded with him to step down. No he said, he just moved to the I-party and stayed in power.

He staged a protest outside of a state official's private residence with insane levels of incendiary calls to violence/arson with a megaphone. While the dude's family is standing terrified by their house and this guy is calling to burn down neighborhoods and shit.

Two or three other examples of this involving police encounters or similar that are so over-the-top that it begins to gel.

He doesn't even LIVE in Minnesota, has a WI address, pulls all these stunts exclusively in the Twin Cities and only against the police/residents that are so wildly crazy and unhinged outrageous that it finally clicked. Dude is a straight asset of the grey state placed in that position to deliberately create racial chaos, instability and division. A military/intelligence operation.

Now the kicker, imo.

ANOTHER episode happened Sunday, but check out the bullshit this time.

According to reports ([source](https://www.startribune.com/st-paul-police-chief-says-rep-john-thompson-misused-his-office-in-police-interaction/600167862/)) his daughter was reportedly observed by police to be weaving all over the road and has then also had an EXPIRED LICENSE after getting pulled over. Then just as the police stop is occurring, this Rep J Thompson rolls up on the scene in ANOTHER vehicle and then loses his mind again, creating as much possible strife as he can muster. Where the police chief and his men are again WAY up against the ropes having to issue massive press releases defending themselves from what was, on it's face, a pure and deliberate attempt to foster some sort of Georg Floyd-type trigger event. 

This metro area has had a slow drip of these events CONSTANTLY where in almost every single case it's almost impossible to wrap your head around the sense of the timeline and see any part of it as ""normal"" in its discourse.

So the theory is that these ""agents"" are being deliberately placed into positions (using fake elections) across the spectrum of powers (like the dudes running NYC for example) and then creating ""skits"" that play out in the ""news"". 

Eye-watering levels of attacks in NYC and the entire power structure is like a literal clown show dancing around (doing nothing) while flapping their gums on camera like narcissistic actors/actresses enjoying their jobs destroying the USA like it's a huge joke.

Anyway, this event with Rep Thompson screams ""skit"". A setup that was 100% planned and contrived to create the police encounter, and then the Rep ""defending his daughter"" from the ""bad police"" narrative....

No man with a shred of decency or logic would do what this person is doing over and over.

It's possible this is one of many facets of the military operation to destabilize the country from within. The bail-funds letting out violent criminals. Releasing violent criminals from prison due to ""Covid"", and now we're seeing INSANE levels of violent crime spikes everywhere. A Soros-funded local DA apparatus that deliberately releases violent criminals right back into their own neighborhoods for continued breakdown, etc, etc.

Businesses are closing down ALL over the twin cities and the paper just shrugs and does a ""cute"" story about the past, but then how violence has driven them out for good. These are small businesses that have been in business for 35 years and are just DONE. 

This is all such bullshit. Thanks.",the_gradient_police,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ucdgnq/rep_john_thompson_of_minnesota_is_an_intelligence/,0

We Are Approaching a Soviet Union-Style Social Order (Northeast U.S.-Please Read!),"Warning: This will be a lengthy post but I hope some will take the time to read it. I am putting this out there so that anyone going through similar circumstances will know they are not alone. I also hope to shed light on the insidious, creeping authoritarian nature of the culture that is still being cultivated around ""COVID"" here in the Northeast U.S., even though many would like to believe it's ""over.""

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a (former) education worker in the state of New Jersey. My work history was mostly in blue collar labor until I got hurt years ago. After some consistent nudging from a very kind neighbor, I applied to work in the school system. For background, I never thought I would step foot back in a school after I graduated high school. I attended a technical institute after high school and earned a certification in my field but I was never a ""model student."" In fact, I grew up in a bad neighborhood and was, generally,  what you might call a ""troubled youth."" Thankfully, I never ended up in juvenile detention but I say all of this to say that I have a soft spot for kids that are misunderstood. I believe this is what made me so effective in the education field. 

I was hired as an aide for children with various emotional and developmental challenges/disabilities, at the middle school level (ages 11-14). I was shocked to find how much I enjoyed the field. It was so much more rewarding than throwing boxes around in a warehouse or delivering packages. Finally, I had found a job that I could leave at the end of the day feeling empowered and hopeful instead of frustrated and exhausted, something I could see being a career, versus a dead-end. I also saw how much it meant to the students to have a fairly youthful, strong, male presence; as education is overwhelmingly populated by female teachers and administrators. I performed this work in two different schools over the past 4 years, always receiving excellent feedback from the parents and teachers I worked with.

&amp;nbsp;

My reputation preceded me to the point where I was recruited by a local high school in the spring of 2021, after accompanying my 8th grade student on his tour of the school, which he would be attending in the fall. The special services director essentially ""headhunted"" me on the spot and thought I would be a great addition to the special services team. I was excited about the possibility and we exchanged information so I could apply for the position when the district began accepting submissions that summer.

The state of New Jersey's fascist, former Goldman-Sachs executive governor, Phil Murphy, dropped our indoor mask mandate the entire summer of 2021. Actually, the mandate was dropped during the last week of school in June 2021 because of ""extreme heat."" I guess ""COVID"" is only scary when the temperatures are to our liking. Of course, magically, ""COVID"" became such a threat that he HAD to reinstate the mask mandate...one week before the fall 2021 school year began. Conveniently timed so that no district could oppose and no parents would have time to think about the absurdity of it all.

&amp;nbsp;

Throughout the fall 2020-spring 2021 school year, I experienced a ton of adverse reactions to masking. I don't know how or why. Many peers and colleagues around me claimed it wasn't a ""big deal"" for them. Personally, I went from *vigorously* exercising 4 days a week consistently to coming home after work, sitting on the couch for 5 minutes and passing out. I got headaches. I felt dizzy. I would often have bouts of sleep paralysis during these naps and would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I was unable to breathe. I even passed out one day out of nowhere. My wife (who is a family doctor/general practitioner) was concerned but did not believe that the adverse effects were mask-related because she also wore a mask in her office all day. I told her that I knew for a fact it was the masks and never wavered in my suspicion.

This is relevant because, as I said, one week before the fall semester of 2021, our governor randomly reinstated the indoor mask mandate *for schools only*...because...you know? The Science! I knew I couldn't continue masking, not only due to the personal health effects it was having on me but I also felt that my students had suffered due to the lack of facial expression and communication the past year. I asked my wife (who IS my primary care doctor) to provide a note of exemption, which she reluctantly did, still not totally convinced that my issues had been mask related, even though ALL of my symptoms had subsided over the summer break while masks were not mandated. So, I received a call from the special services director at the high school that had specifically gone out of his way to hire me that summer, asking if I was comfortable wearing a ridiculous ""plastic face shield."" I thought it was ridiculous but agreed. It seemed like a happy medium. I continued my on-boarding process, including drug screen. This is where the story starts to get nuts.

&amp;nbsp;

I reported to a local hospital testing facility, which was the official vendor for the high school's screening process. I walk into the building bare-faced (*gasp*) and present my mask exemption notice. The woman performing my pre-employment drug test FREAKS OUT like I had a loaded gun. Raises her hands and everything. She is now in the lobby screaming ""Sir! Please put on a mask!"" as I calmly try to explain that I have a health issue and if she will just hand me the cup, I will enter the single-occupancy toilet, pee in the cup and exit the building. She then tells me that she refuses to perform the test and I won't be able to start my job unless I comply right now. Fine. I put the stupid surgical mask around my mouth. She INSISTS that it be over my nose and tightly wrapped. I get the cup, go in the bathroom, pee and come out. She writes the tag for the sample, I sign it and on my way out I tell her, ""you should be very proud, you're a good German!""

&amp;nbsp;

The first day I report for work, I'm called into HR. They begin to talk about my masking exemption and claim suddenly that a face shield is ""not good enough"" because there's ""too much open space"" and that the open space of the face shield is less effective than the open space around a mask because the mask ""is closer to the face."" The Science! I explain that I have a note and that I experienced negative reactions to masking and that the supervisor who hired me specifically asked me if I would wear the face shield. No response. 

The HR director then attempted to coerce me into signing a document that would release access to my COMPLETE medical history, in perpetuity for the 2021-22 school year, over to their ""district physician"" for review. I objected on the grounds that their district physician was not MY physician, I did not know them or have any prior medical/professional relationship with them so why should they have the final word to validate or discredit my primary care physician? I was stonewalled at every question. No answers, just coercion. ""Come on, just sign the paper! We're not going to dig into your medical history, it's just a formality."" I refused.

&amp;nbsp;

Next, the HR director called in a union rep and began grilling me about ""statements that were made to a nurse who performed my pre-employment drug screening."" I was appalled. I replied that I was not required to contextualize private comments I had made outside of school grounds and that the fact that a medical professional had divulged such information was extremely unethical. No response. I was sent home on my first day of work and told not to return until further notice.


Later that day, I called the Department of Health in my county. They claimed that a face shield WAS as acceptable form of PPE for those unable to wear a mask but the clerk would not send me anything in writing to present to the school. I contacted attorneys. They practically hung up on me before I finished the word ""mask."" Everyone was seemingly backing away from the apparatus of state power. If you have read any history about the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, etc. you will recognize that this is a very bad sign. The rules have been turned upside down and now bureaucracy is the only rule of law.

&amp;nbsp;

I was called into a disciplinary hearing about a week later with the superintendent of the district. They railroaded me, hired someone to dig into public records regarding my personal life, questioned me as to why my wife was my doctor and insisted that my mask exemption must be fake because of my relationship to her. They grilled me about my comment to the nurse during my drug screen and the superintendent remarked that he considered it a ""slur"" to call someone German in this context. I was fired on the spot and told him that I appreciated being relieved from my position, due to the obvious authoritarian nature of the school administration.

I've been through a lot in my life but it's funny how these experiences can give you a slight touch of PTSD when all is said and done. It felt like a bad fever dream. It felt like the Twilight Zone. Had I really been discarded like trash from a career that I had been so dedicated to for the past 3 years, over a mask and my God-given right to free speech? Was competence not even a consideration anymore? I knew that we were now truly in the throes of a runaway authoritarian regime and it was high time for me to leave this state. Unfortunately, it's not so easy for my wife to pick up and leave just yet.

&amp;nbsp;

So after being denied unemployment because I was ""insubordinate"" and ""unprofessional,"" according to my former employer, I began looking for another job. I eventually found one. Actually, it wasn't just *A JOB*, it seemed like *THE JOB*. It was absolutely perfect for my skill set. Running a youth recreation center at the high school level. Planning events, driving engagement and helping troubled, misfit youth. I knew I would get the position. I applied and was interviewed the following week. During my interview, I made it clear that if any vaccine mandate were to be passed in the state, my resignation would be effective immediately. I was hired by the end of the week. The director of the program stated that they did still follow the mask mandate but by this point, I had been tipped off to the ""minimal compliance"" mesh masks by a nurse friend and ordered those just to prevent what had happened at my last job.

I hit the ground running at the rec center. I was hired in December 2021 and in January I held my first event, which more than 70 students attended. I had another event planned for mid-February. I had initially been hesitant about moving from the middle school level to high school, as I thought high school-aged students to be a bit more ""angsty"" and disinterested but eventually realized that those students were probably struggling the most with the lack of socialization and they would benefit from someone ""normal"" being there to engage with them. 

&amp;nbsp;

The director of the program seemed like a good guy, with a solid head on his shoulders. We had more than a couple private, candid conversations surrounding the damage that ""COVID"" restrictions had done and continued to do. He talked about hating the masks and when I met with him in his office, we would both always remove our masks. He claimed he ""only got the first two shots"" because he thought it would exempt him from masking and he loved his beard too much to shave it but the booster was his last straw and he would never take it. Lol.

The rest of the staff were pretty much ""COVID-crazy."" Obsessively paranoid, middle-aged, white, suburban moms; one of whom gave me a Christmas ornament of Santa with a mask on, holding a syringe that had ""vaccine"" written on it. Another of the staff told me she wanted to ""inject me in my sleep"" with the vaccine, in the event that a mandate was passed, so that I could keep working there because of how good I was with the students. I nervously laughed it off.

&amp;nbsp;

Rumors of a vaccine mandate came in January and sure enough, by the end of the month, a notice was sent out that due to the fact that ""psychotherapy"" was performed on the premises of the youth center, that we were ""classified as a healthcare facility"" and this justified every employee receiving THREE mRNA jabs. I was firm in my stance and ready to resign but I submitted a religious exemption, citing the Bible as a source, due to the fact that any forced medical procedure is against my spiritual and moral compass. 

After submitting my request, HR responded that the company attorney would like me to ""interpret"" the scriptures in my own words, to show how they were ""relevant"" to my exemption request. I did so. HR then responded that they would like to know what my stance was on ""vaccination, in general."" At this point, I had had enough. I explained that I had not received ANY vaccines since childhood, including the flu shot and would not be answering any further questions regarding my personal opinions on medical science. I was fired. The company ""graciously"" gave me two weeks notice before my date of termination.

&amp;nbsp;

The Thursday of my first week before termination, the director came to the rec room with tears in his eyes and asked to see me. We went back to his office. The HR director was there. She and the program director, my direct supervisor; who, just a week prior to this had told me that I was ""literally made for this job"" proceeded to serve me with a slanderous, falsified disciplinary document against me, alleging that I had ""not properly worn a mask"" and vaguely stating that I had ""inappropriate interactions with students,"" a statement by which I am still absolutely disgusted and infuriated. I threw the document in both their faces and said ""this is all lies, I will not sign this."" As I walked out, I told my former supervisor, straight up, that he should be ashamed of himself.

&amp;nbsp;

You might think this was all justified. You might think I'm just some trouble-maker who can't hold down a job. You might think the ends justify the means of getting people vaccinated to ""stay safe."" You're wrong. This kind of gross dishonesty, lying, snitching and conniving is done by those whose minds have been wholly captured by the authoritarian regime. You may think the tables will never turn on you, that you won't be their next target but I promise that you will. Any incentive or, conversely, any inconvenience imposed by the state to encourage people to turn on their neighbors will eventually come back to haunt you as well. 

Stories like mine will never make the news. We're too small. We go ignored and unnoticed. We should've just done what we were told if we didn't want to be targeted. This is why my empathy, compassion and ability to trust have been entirely eroded over the past two years. I don't want to see anyone. I don't want to speak to anyone. The state of New Jersey has become an open-air mental institution where psychotic despots have seized the reigns of power and are now gate-keeping every sector, based on how thoroughly and completely you submit to their gospel that ""COVID"" is the most important issue of our lifetime and the only way to salvation is through the fascist merger of government-enforced mandates with the false prophets of the medical industrial complex. This is Lysenkoism in Soviet Russia. A complete distortion of the scientific method in service to a totalitarian ""truth."" Please take this seriously.

Historians could look back and say we are in WW3 right now.,"Where does the current global direction go from here?  There is a major conflict of philosophy and governance between the “east v west”.  Ukraine is only the beginning..what about Taiwan and pretty much all of Asia?  You think CCP will let them be?  I do not see the world problems going away through resolution, so what does that lead to?  Possibly a never ending “war” of ideas and governance to keep everyone in check.  

The only hope for avoiding a major global conflict is for both sides to accept the other and move on.  West will not give up “freedom” and east will not give up “control”.  But that has not happened, and in fact we are seeing increasingly hostile acts/speech from both sides.  

Crops, solarwinds, cargo ships, foreign investment destroying real estate, espionage, blatant propaganda denouncing entire nations, identification and accountability for every single human on the planet (Covid).

"Potential Lawsuit Vs Melina Abdullah, Individually, Black Lives Matter Foundation, Aka BLM","My name is Cody Leeder, individual and a resident of Los Angeles County, California. Cruvoir Corporation is a California corporation conducting business as a high-end designer clothing store, located at 8211 Melrose Avenue West Hollywood, CA 90046 CA. 

I owned the store for five years prior to the looting that occurred on May 30th, 2020 when the Mayor of California ordered the LAPD a stand down mandate during the Black Lives Matter marches. Scores of opportunists &amp; masked armed looters took advantage, damaging commercial &amp; personal property &amp; engaging in open theft, vandalism, &amp; violent destruction of my property. 

The total damages were over 1.5 million dollars of designer clothing, sneakers, jewelry, and rare vintage pieces. None of my property was covered by Insurance, so we have shuttered our doors until we can reopen when permitted. 

As members of the conspiracies alleged more fully in court, Melina Abdullah—lead organizer of BLM LA chapter participated and acted with or in furtherance of said conspiracy and performed acts and made statements in furtherance of the conspiracy and other violations of California law. 

I am looking to consult with advisors in my individual capacity for injunctive relief from constitutional violations by BLM on the counts of Property Damage, Vandalism &amp; Loss of Business Income, and negligence by Mayor Eric Garcetti and the LAPD. Unfortunately due to the stay-at-home mandate, I wasn't able to protect my property until it was too late. 

Surveillance footage is published on Cruvoir YouTube channel of the looting that on occurred during the BLM riots on May 30, 2020.

My neighbors, either escaped or didn't take action. Only one person showing some courage to defend my business amidst the chaos while X amount of people are running out of my store with handfuls of merchandise, was knocked unconscious with a skateboard —he suffered trauma to the back of his head and was carried away.

I called the police &amp; they told me to stay home. Special scorn should be given to LAPD Chief Michel Moore and Mayor Garcetti for serving up the entire heart of the city to thieves and arsonists. Unfortunately due to the stay-at-home mandate, I wasn't able to protect my property until it was too late. By the time I got there, I witnessed the break-ins around me that were bonkers in their scale &amp; frequency that went on into late hours of the night, by the same criminals that looted my store and took everything—pure crime. Standing in front of my store, which was already mostly destroyed &amp; robbed, I filmed Police driving by a live crime scene as the jewelry store across the street was broken into (see Cruvoir youtube). Police Chief Michael Moore kept hundreds of police in clustered units, doing nothing under Mayor Garcetti's 'stand-down order'— Cops were antagonizing protestors, while businesses in the vicinity were looted and burned two blocks away. I witnessed police squad vehicles driving past live crime scenes, ignoring looting. Why didn't the police go after the looters and leave the protests? Both sides, every time. The police aren't there for you. 'Protect and serve' is a lie.

The protesters were honoring Dr. Melina Abdullah, lead organizer of Black Lives Matter’s L.A. chapter, who led call and response chants of “disrupt white capitalism,” a concept she believes is the root cause of police violence in America. Abdullah, who is also a college professor, went on to drop a string of expletives that seemingly foreshadowed what was to come after the rally would end. “F\*\*\* the police,” she shouted into the megaphone. “F\*\*\* white capitalism. F\*\*\* The Grove. F\*\*\* 3rd and Fairfax. F\*\*\* Beverly Hills.” By nightfall, stores at every shopping district Abdullah mentioned had been vandalized and looted, and several LAPD cruisers in the Fairfax District were set on fire.

By nightfall, stores at every shopping district Abdullah mentioned had been vandalized and looted. Abdullah’s 16-year-old daughter, Thandiwe, also addressed rallygoers. She co-founded the Black Lives Matter Youth Vanguard and has been speaking at local protests for several years. In 2018, she was honored by Time Magazine as one of the most influential teens in the country. “I know you want to cry, I know you want to tear some shit up,” Thandiwe said. “If you want to set some corporations on fire, you know what? I don’t care about Target burning. I don’t care that capitalism burns. I don’t care that white people in their f\*\*\*ing office buildings are upset. I don’t care that you can’t go nowhere because you’re stuck in f\*\*\*ing traffic. I don’t care that you can’t get to your job or your doctor’s appointment or to wherever the f\*\*\* you want to go.”

How it went down: A city permit was given to Black Lives Matter to hold an event at Pan Pacific Park on May 30th in the afternoon—a small park, not an event park—it looks crowded with 200 people in it. Whoever gave the permit should be fired—this was the first mistake that led to violence, theft, and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage for many miles.

At Pan Pacific Park, Dr. Melina Abdullah, lead organizer of Black Lives Matter's LA chapter, led call and response chants of ""disrupt white capitalism."" Before the event ended, Abdullah shouted into a megaphone: ""Fuck the police! Fuck white capitalism! Fuck The Grove! Fuck 3rd and Fairfax! Fuck Beverly Hills! (Daily Wire)

[Dr. Melina Abdullah, lead organizer of Black Lives Matter's LA chapter](https://preview.redd.it/rfsy2k2norv81.jpg?width=4500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24d7b57bf95645ad5ccff96a20d3b066439f2b95)

*The following interview has been abbreviated and edited for clarity.*

Warren Olney: Talk about the looting and violence that took place at the protests in LA over the weekend. 

**Melina Abdullah**: “We were very deliberate in deciding to disrupt spaces of white affluence. We want to make sure that it's not just black people who are suffering at the hands of white supremacy, that if we can bring a little bit of the pain that we feel to white communities, then maybe they'll have a vested interest in  ... and disrupting these systems that kill our people. They can't simply turn their heads and retreat from what we're experiencing. 

I think it's a huge mistake for people to be equating what happens to property with what happens to the lives of black people. We need to shift that. We also need to remember that in these demonstrations, the first acts of violence are the police assaulting protesters. And it's important that the media examines that.”

Melina Abdullah was deliberately stoking a very large crowd into destructive action in the middle of the day as the event was ending. She knew exactly what she was doing. Organizers ended the rally while it was still peaceful, acknowledging the situation could potentially become 'unsafe' for some people in attendance. A Black Lives Matter leader said over the bullhorn. ""The action is officially closed,"" he announced. ""Whatever y'all do from here on out ain't my business."" Tensions began to rise after the protesters began moving toward Beverly Hills and other areas. They were met by LAPD, which issued an 'unlawful assembly' order and instructed participants and onlookers to leave. The LA Times described the scene that developed as 'a tense standoff' with police shooting rubber bullets and striking demonstrators with batons. (CBS2)

At this point, putting too many people in too small an area, firing them up with angry rhetoric, then telling them to leave the park in the middle of the day left the police in an untenable position. Should they direct the large crowd one way or another? This crowd was amped. A total mess ensued. Many were driven North, to Melrose Avenue, only five blocks away, where the police would not go for four hours. Who's fault? The next mistake was LAPD's strategy of handling what was inevitable. There would be parts of this crowd plus opportunistic hooligans spreading out to tag, rob, and burn for many square miles—after everything was looted, someone would start a fire inside.

One of my neighbors roamed a mile of Melrose with her camera. Over four hours, she saw zero police crackdown —one big candy store! The Shoe Palace was looted for a full hour before someone started fires inside. Urban Outfitters was continuously looted for two hours before fires were started inside. My Store, Cruvoir at 8211 Melrose Avenue, was looted for hours until I got there, and nearly everything was gone and destroyed.

The Los Angeles Police Department deliberately abandoned Melrose and other major streets, deciding not to 'risk' department 'lives' and 'reputations' for property damage—better to let the looters loot and burn? All LAPD had to do was criss-cross and block critical streets with squad cars and bullhorns. It would have scattered the crowd. Wherever there were broken windows, put a car in front of it with police standing guard. It would have stopped all the fires and continuous looting that went on for hours.

Law enforcement officials, current and retired, criticized the LAPD response, saying it was riddled with flaws—from acquiescing to protesters gathering in huge numbers in a business district like Fairfax, to delaying two moves that would have increased manpower sooner— mobilizing the entire police force into action by canceling off-days and vacations, and calling in the National Guard—as they were given warning well-ahead of time. 

Charles Sid Heal, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff's commander, said the LAPD decision to allow protesters access to an area like the Grove and Farmers Market was a miscalculation. Keeping crowds away from vulnerable areas is a vital part of crowd control, he said. ""That means place sentries where you don't want them to go in advance."" (LA Times)

The “Make it Cool” Strategy,"I remember years ago when there was a lot of talk about a cashless society. With the powers that be wanting to destroy cash in order to track and control money. All comments on the topic were greatly against this of course.

Fast forward and in comes crypto, created by this mysterious “person”. Touted as a way to stick it to the fiat system and do our own thing. Totally separate, totally anonymous like cash.

We dont know who, or better, what group/government(s) started this. But what better way to organically drive mass interest in wanting to go CASHLESS. 

Look how fast the anonymity aspect is going bye bye. In fact, crypto folks went from touting separatism and anonymity, to calling for more regulation and oversight. Literally begging for government control of a digital currency. I mean, for fuck sake, folks are paying taxes on it, TAXES. So much for sticking it to the man.

This of course leads the way for CBDCs. China already has the digital Yuan. The US is mulling digital dollar. For most, this would be “awesome” and “cool”.

10 facts about cholesterol your doctor doesn't tell you.,"1. Cholesterol is an essential nutrient that makes up the cell membrane of every cell in the body. 
2. The human brain is over 50% fat and cholesterol by dry weight.

3. Vitamins A, D, and E are cholesterol molecules. 

4. LDL is a lipoprotein which carries cholesterol to the needed parts of the body. It is not a cholesterol nor is it 'bad'. It serves a very important function to all our cells that need cholesterol. 
5. HDL is also a lipoprotein which carries excess cholesterol from the cells back to the liver. It serves an important function and is no more 'good' or 'bad' than LDL.

6. The 'Total cholesterol' number your doctor gives you is a calculation done from your triglycerides, HDL, and LDL. The formula assumes every LDL and HDL molecule is saturated with cholesterol which usually isn't the case. It's like counting the population of a school by counting the busses. It's just an estimate.
7. If the body doesn't get enough cholesterol in the diet it will make its own. Which is why low cholesterol diets will barely put a dent on your cholesterol levels.
8. Since diet has low affect on cholesterol levels doctors push Statins, which prevent some of the body's manufacture of cholesterol.  Which is a pill you take for life.
9. Taking Statins and preventing your cells from getting an essential part it needs to function leads to side-effects you can expect. Confusion, memory loss, and drastic personality changes due to the brain being deprived, muscle aches due to the body cells being deprived, etc. Not to mention the other issues (kidney/heart/etc) taking statins for long periods can cause.


10. Eating unhealthy vegetable and seed oils  (e.g. soy, canola) replaces healthy lipids in your cells for less functional, more rigid ones, which can eventually lead to breakdown and the same issues as not getting enough cholesterol in the first place. Sadly these unhealthy oils get 'heart healthy' labels while healthy sources of fat (animal) get vilified, leading to the nation getting even sicker.

"I was looking at Elon Musk buying Twitter. I was smirking at all the soy-boys complaining about it - I felt it was a win. However, it then hit me.","I was falling for the trap. I genually believe, that Elon Musk's role, is to get a different demographic on board with the ditgital ID scheme.

A good example of where something similar happening, to explain my thoughts, is with Trump. Trump, in my opinion, bridged the gap between the Conspiracy Theorists and the political system - he got a bunch of people that did not care about politics but rather the truth, and made them believe in the 'system'.

Similarly,  currently, it is only the liberals, that are on board with this digital ID scheme - ie vaccine passports. 

The elites need a way to branch out to the other half of the population, to get them on board with it. Similary to Trump, they bring Elon Musk, as a false saint, to clean up their social media platform supposedly - but while doing this he brings human verification.

This in turn, brings a social ID society, allowing expansions in authoritarian policies, like the great reset. to commence.

And guess what? It's working.

The target audience is loving it - the people who are angry and leaving are already onboard with the authoritarian plans, and the ones that like it, encourage it and suck it up.

"The Evolution of a Lie: Texts Reveal how the GOP came up with the ""ANTIFA is Storming the Capitol"" fabrication","""Mark, I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wrote to Meadows as the attack took place. “Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything.”

It’s a message that presumes Trump was the only person in a position to do anything about the situation.

“Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?” wrote Mick Mulvaney, another former chief of staff, to Meadows.

“It’s really bad up here on the hill,” Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) wrote to Meadows, adding later: “This doesn’t help our cause.”

All the texts up to this point presumed that it was Trump supporters behind the insurrection, until Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller interjected with some spin: 

# Blame it on Antifa.

“Ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, **likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists**, infiltrated today’s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now!” Miller wrote. The second idea suggested that “the fake news media who encouraged this summer’s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions.”

Texts [released](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/pre-jan-6-oath-keeper-texts-show-terror-at-the-idea-of-a-massive-antifa-army-in-dc) from the Oath Keepers — some of whom composed the mob inside the Capitol — took a similar line.

When one Oath Keeper not present in Washington suggested that Antifa was responsible, the group’s leader, Stewart Rhodes, replied: “Look, I WAS THERE. I WAS RIGHT OUSIDE. Patriots stormed in. Not Antifa.”

But within hours, House Republicans lean in on the Antifa line.

“Mark we don’t think these attackers are our people,” Rep. Taylor Greene wrote in another, later message. “We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.”",zensins,31,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ucbg6a/the_evolution_of_a_lie_texts_reveal_how_the_gop/,0
Something isn't right.,"Well, I got the coof again. This will be the 3rd time, but each time was totally different than the others. The 1st time was at the end of 2019. Of course I can't prove it, but my symptoms were different than any cold I ever had. My hearing sounded like I was in a tunnel or going up in a plane, and I woke up multiple time gasping for air because my brain just decided to tell my body to stop breathing. Second time was this year, January 8th. Confirmed with 2 rapid tests. I had a high fever, headache, chills and pretty much felt drained. It was gone on day 4 like it never happened. Didn't lose my smell and taste until after I felt better. Now today I woke up congested. Feels exactly like every cold I ever had. Lungs a little phlegmy, coughing, but I can still taste and smell. Tested positive with a rapid test.

Conspiracy theorists are doing psyops with nestle factory burning. Did you not know nestle and johnson and Johnson did bio war in Africa for a decade? Use water as chemical weapon?,"Nestle formula killed several thousand African babies, all the while nestle sponsored scientists said it didn't happen.

They were/are also waging a water war.
Jesse Ventura conspiracy  theory show had a great lake conspiracy where food companies want to occupy all the water sources so they can sell bottled water and do chemical warfare.

Johnson and Johnson had AZT in children's products for years.

Why are conspiracy theorists so distracted nowadays, they were not supposed to be backdated. Focus on the main issue connected to the institutions. Not everything is a conspiracy. Even if it is, it is one of the smaller cogs in a giant warmachine, a beast, dajjal.",DefenderOfMontrocity,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ubvc3p/conspiracy_theorists_are_doing_psyops_with_nestle/,0
Meanwhile in Canada..,"So today 3 articles pop up on my Twitter feed with essentially the same headline. “Being with unvaccinated people increases risk of COVID-19 for Vaccinated people, study finds”  

I am at a loss for words. As a duel citizen who moved from Canada to the US mid pandemic, I am honestly shocked that Canada is still pushing this narrative. In the 7 months I’ve lived in Arizona, I can count on one hand how many times my vaccination status has been brought up. It hasn’t kept me from going to bars, concerts, sporting events, or working. However, I still cannot return to Canada without having to quarantine for 14 days. My vaccination status has all but ruined my
Relationship with my dad (who is still in Canada and seemingly loves to drink the tea and live in fear). And its because of the media in Canada and this insane propaganda they continue to push. It honestly makes me sick to my stomach. 

These articles, which I’ll post below, are mathematical studies based on essentially nothing, and were conducted by none other than David Fishman, a paid consultant of AstraZeneca and Phizer.

Does anyone have anything they can share with me that will discredit these articles? I want some fuel before I go to my dad and try to get him to see my side for the thousandth time. Thanks in advance

Book banning is back?!,There a decently large surge in books being banned for their content. This originally happened because the governments and school boards wanted to prevent the spread of ideas that might upset the societal norm. Has anyone ever been apart or a school boards vote for these type of bans? And how is the rationale sold to strip people of the opportunity for knowledge? Are we stunting our own ability to think?

Financial system reset," Leviticus 25:10:

""Then you are to sound the horn far and wide on the **tenth day** of the **seventh month**, the Day of Atonement. You shall sound it throughout your land. So you are to consecrate the **fiftieth year** and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be your **Jubilee**, **when each of you is to return to his property** and to his clan.""

&amp;#x200B;

1971-1972, gold standard abolished and enslavement of the middle/low class plan finalized. 

50 (**fiftieth)** years later = 2021-2022.

Seventh month = September (Sept), watch September 10th closely. 

I believe November is also a pretty important month, we'll s33.

**Destroy the old system:**

\-SWIFT payment messaging system dead (down 90-95% in volume from 2021 to 2022), money no longer a weapon via sanctions. USD dropped as the global reserve currency.

\-Housing bubble, majority of houses are owned by mega-rich investors. Think 2008 recession but 10x worse. The average house could be worth 5 digits to low 6 digits.  ""It shall be your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property**"".**

\-Nasdaq/S&amp;P500 (potentially) reached their 100-year cycle top, many fortune 500 companies wont survive.

\-Banks go offline (Solar flare, hack, banks implode), debt suddenly disappears. Afterwards, CBDC will be airdropped to citizens.

\-Energy crisis, countries like Canada and the US resume using their own pipelines. Gas is cheap again, carbon tax likely removed after next elections.

\-Liquidity crisis, USD no longer the global reserve currency. New global reserve currency needs to be adopted, quick.

\-Food shortages + Supply chain issues = attempt from current controlling powers (bankers/Evelyn Rothschild) to prevent new financial system.

\-Covid, expose the current controlling powers (deep state) and their 'green initiative' (?). Last ditch effort from deep state to impose martial law and maintain full control over the world.

\-Russia/Ukraine war, expose US corruption/weakness, remove USD as global reserve currency, expose IMF for their debt scam, destroy current payment system (SWIFT).

\-Commodity bull run caused  by inflation, war, supply chain issues, food shortages, energy crisis, Covid, etc... is a last ditch attempt for deep state to cash out before the new financial system. Stock $ ---&gt; Commodities before their businesses die and stocks plummet. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**New system:**

Asset backed currencies:

\-Russia essentially backs currency with gold, others must follow otherwise their currency is worthless.

\-Gold backed currency removes inflation, the hidden tax.

\-Pension/savings no longer a scam as they are not severely devalued over time and only subject to (minor) volatility.

\-Gold backed currency strips a severe amount of power from the U.S government, central banks as well as the top banks (JP Morgan, HSBC, etc...). JP Morgan wont be able to direct the Federal Reserve to print money endlessly, inflating their assets at the expense of the middle/low class and the U.S cant use money as a weapon via sanctions.

\-BASEL III

\-Severely hinder gold manipulation. Comply or die. Essential for when gold becomes the global reserve currency.

 

&amp;#x200B;

DLT/Crypto:

\-ISO20022 (222) adoption in November 2022 (11/22 --&gt; 2/22 --&gt;222). This will occur **33** months after the pandemic started.

\-ISO20022 compliant coins, XRP (source of liquidity for everything), XDC (trade finance/web3), ALGO (web3), QNT (cross-chain interoperability).

\-A decentralized global reserve currency (in which no country is the sole issuer) such as gold or crypto would lead to equal power between several nations (U.S, BRICS and EU most likely).

\-A decentralized global reserve currency would remove the need for the top country in current world order to rake up debt, which has always lead to the fall of said nation once the debt bubble pops.

\-XRP adopted as **the** source of liquidity for the new financial system. A bridge asset like XRP removes the need for small/med banks, financial institutions, businesses and governments to use the top banks (less than 10 banks) liquidity corridors. XRP removes the need for Nostro/Vostro, banks no longer need to have trillions in order to allow their customers to facilitate cross-border payments. The top few banks no longer earning hundreds of billions per year in profits by being the only ones able to facilitate cross-border transactions.

\-NFT's adopted (alongside digital ID) for many use cases, but the most important one (IMO) is preventing voter fraud. Digital ID + NFT + open source DLT platform/txns makes voter fraud impossible.

\-Federal Reserve absorbed into Treasury, Treasury creates cash-like CBDC rather than one proposed by the Federal Reserve in which they have total control over your funds and can monitor every transaction.

\-Defi forces banks to raise apy to 5-15%.

“It can be injected into the body &amp; lay dormant until a trigger is activated. Imagine a cancer causing virus enter a human cell &amp; lay dormant until an external signal triggers the disease. When the signal gets activated the cells generate abnormal growth leading to a tumor &amp; death.” Lt Col Almosara,"Full text:

State of the Bioweapon: Stealth viruses just like the gene therapy, require a vector to be inserted in the body and lay dormant until a trigger mechanism is activated either internally or externally. Imagine having a cancer causing virus enter a human cell and lay dormant until an external signal triggers the disease. When the signal gets activated the cells become abnormal and could rapidly generate abnormal cell growth leading to a tumor and ultimately, death. Now, apply this concept to a population where an HIV virus gets disseminated within a target population. At a specific time chosen by the perpetrator, the signal would be triggered to harm an entire population all at once. Although this bioweapon is futuristic it is not improbable and deserves to be examined.

Story Time....,"I have a male friend who I've known for 12 years now. I just recently found out he was a freemason, of course when I tried to get more info from him he told me he couldn't tell me much. He did however tell me as of 3 years ago he decided to stop attending meetings. I asked why he was no longer interested in being a mason, he advise things were getting weird, he stated at these meeting he had to be blindfolded. He also said they had private sex parties with each other.....Once I found out he was a mason a lot of things that happened to him got me thinking.  About 5 years ago he met and married a lady (who I also just found out she is a eastern star), they got married really quickly. After a few months of being married he ended up in the hospital with an illness the Dr couldn't explain, Doctors didn't think he was going to make it, he was in a coma for weeks. long story short several weeks after he was out of the hospital he move out of their home and file for divorce. He always accused her of trying to kill him, he also mentioned several times that the people at his job were out to kill him as well, he even quit his job because he was so afraid. what I find concerning is around the time he stopped going to meetings his sister suddenly died.  so my questions is, is it possible when he stopped going to the meeting they took out his sister? Also I never knew you could stop going to meetings, I thought once you took the oath you're stuck with them for life. Am I overthinking this or is it possible this could all be connected to him leaving the freemason???

"Life is short don’t stress. TPTB will get theirs in due time, have patience.","With all the madness you’re exposed to that is taking place in the world, you sometimes can feel hopeless as if things will never get better. You have to remind yourself that the world has always been filled with tyrants since the dawn of man. One person trying to influence their will and control over another in hopes of feeling some sort of escape from their own mortality. That never ending chase to feel like some sort of deity that’s absolved from the same fate that we all must face; death. 

With all the human trafficking, embezzlement, debt slavery, corruption, rape, murder, war, genocide, and plethora of atrocities tptb engage in and create it can leave you feeling sick and miserable and understandably so. No matter who is “elected” giving you the shot of hopium you so desperately crave leading to this never ending cycle of despair and being let down after realizing nothing has changed and in fact has only gotten worse until one day you realize everything is rigged. There are no leaders who have your interest at heart or want to change things and if there are they never make it into office and by some chance they do they somehow always end up meeting an unfortunate end via a coup or assassination. 

You see this life is merely a game, once you’ve accumulated enough wealth and resources you only care about maintaining and Increasing it. Tptb know the day will come where dirt will be in their mouths just like the rest of us. Before that happens they want to make sure they live like gods in this world of make belief. A never ending disease of the mind to feel like you’re more than just human. That you somehow are chosen because you were born into some wealthy family or had connections. When In reality despite the villas, vacation homes, cars, jets and myriad of luxuries and privileges, these sorry excuses of humans still shit, get sick, sleep, breathe, and bleed just like us but most importantly die.

It bothers them knowing that. It festers in their mind at night no matter how much they try and deny it or how much they want to delude themselves that AI or the metaverse will save them. Deep down they know they are going to meet the same end just as billions of humans before them. So they pretend like it won’t, they play dress us hoarding mass amounts of shiny things and land, inflicting suffering on countless people as a means to cope with the fate that awaits them. The fate of being forgotten and rotting away while worms and beetles crawl through their once untouchable bodies. 

So enjoy what you can of your time here. Don’t focus on what you can’t change focus on what you can. Sleep with a good conscious knowing you don’t have the blood of anyone on your hands. Rest assured God will deal with them. This life is temporary but hell is permanent for those who inflicted suffering on innocence. Whenever you see these puppet faces and get angry or upset just remember a day is coming where they too shall gasp their last breathes and in that moment they will realize they have a debt that none of us will want to be on the hook for.

Be happy, spread love and realize that the only thing that matters is what good you do while you’re here and how you made this place better for the creatures and people on it and for those you’re leaving it behind for.",jacokapi,45,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ubgoht/life_is_short_dont_stress_tptb_will_get_theirs_in/,0

"Reality Conspiracy: Perception is 9/10 of the Law. My theory on Perception Based Reality, Manifeststion, and Mandela Effects.","For all my deep thinkers, i want to share a crazy theory ive been building lately. Fair warning, its wild and has to do with mandela effects and our perceptions influence over reality...

This is a vauge idea, not a core belief, i dont have all the answers, but i feel like this could hold a few. Im looking to discuss about it and hear other thoughts.

Lets start with that feeling, sonder? Realizing everyone living thier own unique, fully fleshed out lives around you... Well, what if there were multiple realities exisiting at once as weyll, and our energy, memory, and understanding or perception of our reality determines which one we are present in. X

We already know the world around us, atleast to some degree, is based upon our perception of it, quantum physics proved that. But if there are limitless perceptions of reality, how is there only one reality in existance? Building on that, if perception can influence reality, can it do so retroactively to influence the past into a difference existance?

If we all remember our collective human history a certain way, rome, greece, england, the mongols egypt, the world wars, etc, could that be ""reverse manifestation of the past"", it is because we remember it to be so, atleast at a majority scale.

If so, the term that the winner dictates history takes on a new meaning. By influencing the memory and understanding of a the majority of a population, you could not just figuratively but literally wipe away history from their collective realitty and write your own. The original, true reality would maybe exist parralel to the new reality to some degree, until the last person died or forgot. 

When we consider this against the presence of the mandela effect, it paints a larger picture. Smaller realities may exist to some degree to us,  maybe just within our memory, or perhaps extending slightly into the world around us. But there is a larger projection of reality a person sees when they peer beyond their realm of influence.

However, there exist an overwrite system of sorts to keep reality relatively balanced. Whatever the majority if people remember is projected as the physical reality, which can shift and change as our perception of it does. Perhaps this used to happen throughout history, but occured between people with limited communication to share their realities and influence others or notice differences between them. 

Now, in the information age, we are just beginning to see these effects in action as we see the world on a larger scale.

Thats why most mandela effects are brands, because when they change some aspect of thier logo, eventuslly over time the majority of people forget about the existance of the original, wjen that happens the majority remembered existance becomes reality, and if you look back it always was, because the lesser remwmbered reality is no longer projected into the physical world.

For example...

Curious george had a tail. Then the animators stoppes drawing it to make his design easier, new viewers never saw him with a tail, so in their reality theu percieve that doesnt have one and assume he never did, at some point this became the majority and then became the observeable reality. Same thing when Jiffy peanut butter turned to Jif.

This can occur on a much larger and signifcant scale when some inflential power begins writing its own history and distributing it to people in masse as fact. This could tie into religion and the existance of gods as well.

Huge caveat to all this is it almost guarentees reality was created by intelligent design, and this acts as a sort of feature to save memory and limit overlap and conflict between percieved realities.

I know this is alot, but its been on my ming a long time and ive put an extreme amount of thought into all these points so i really hope my people are out there somewhere and this resonates with someone.

Twitter is Purging Bots Left and Right. It's Amazing.,"A lot of fake profiles that had verified accounts are now unverified. The twitter employees are crying on their twitter about how Elon is bossing them around. These bots have been the bane of my existence for two years. But people are still being manipulated af. I'm fairly sure my account is still shadow banned. If you can see my tweet, and if you have twitter, retweet this because I am so sick of how the two-party system tries to divide and conquer. People need to see the bs shit that happened. 

The right is trying to make it as if Elon is on their side. This is all they posted. Every conservative account. They were first against Elon, and then suddenly they changed their minds.

"I see a lot of posts regarding economics (and complaints thereof). What I don't see, is the questioning of it's structure: ""What about the Stock Market""?","Money is one thing: great for getting stuff one needs, yet a vulnerable scheme.

***

**Economics #102:**

1. Barter/Trade

2. Investment

Barter is simple: *""I need something - you have it: let's trade*"".

Or:

* One can make something, and trade it for something in return.

Second tier comes about with storage of value for the long run:

* Gold / Receipts / Loans / Money

***

So what about the *STOCK* market?

&gt;!*Baah*!&lt;

It's an invisible structure above barter and money, where one can *INVEST* for the long run - or for particular gains.

Not necessarily in one's own goods &amp; services, mind you, but in others'. And not necessarily in money either.

**Question:**

* Who set it up?

* Who owns that thing?

To me, it enables parasites to parasite, yet is never discussed. I can't do much about it either, because it's a structure beyond my control. But I can control whether my company participate or not.

The GME-crowd will go love this one, but think about it:

* What would the world look like without it?

Is it just developmental self-evidence / an inevitability?

Or is it just an 'elite-structure' for 'elites' to stay 'elites'?

The Ukrainian army response that they don't use Fléchettes is alleged to be a lie. According to the JCCC, during shelling of Horlivka from 2015-2018, the Ukrainian armed forces did use Fléchettes among other ammunitions. 

The Russian forces in Bucha consisted of light troops in the form of paratroopers and special forces. How would they have this kind of heavy artillery and why would they use it on its own positions?

Your house will have a Twitter page, your car will to and your house AI bot. These private/public Twitter pages will feed you updates and live feeds and you will be able to pass instructions and control all your devices.

Elon is creating the next boom industry and will own the main infrastructure, just like Zucke is trying to do with Meta and owning the virtual version of Twitter.

Who else is in New York? Epstein. So of course there will be Epstein eugenics vaccine.

Epstein was friends of lots of doctors because he was funding lots of research and stealing lots of data. He was also shadow board member of MIT and other institutions.


Vicky Ward made a documentary called chasing Ghislaine, it was the only documentary where Mossad connection with Maxwell sisters were explored.

Elon Musk is going to seize Twitter and unsuspend Donald Trump's Twitter Account,"Censorship and deplatforming someone based on political differences and a different background is never ok.  This type of censorship is extremely toxic and sets a precedence leading to a 'my way or the highway' for a dystopia.  Removing politicians, political opponent and organizations is what a dictator does.  It is time for a social media organization to have new management when something like this happens.

Elon is close to being in charge of Twitter and as an advocate who speaks for freedom of speech he's going to give Donald Trump his twitter account back.

"“vaccine-induced fatality rate” It was the data and his scientific integrity that compelled him to change his mind Dr. Spiro Pantazatos found the risk associated with COVID injections is comparable to the risk associated with getting COVID in 2020, with the injection risks increasing with each dose.","*A great ‘Perspectives on the Pandemic’ interview with Dr. Spiro Pantazatos. Dr. Pantazatos is not shy at all about sharing his analysis, and he is also tremendously graceful and humble when presenting it.*

&amp;#x200B;

## Story at-a-glance

* Dr. Spiro Pantazatos is a researcher at Columbia University who recently co-authored a study on “vaccine-induced fatality rate”
* His initial reaction to the COVID pandemic was 100% mainstream, and it was the data (and his scientific integrity) that compelled him to change his mind
* Dr. Spiro Pantazatos believes that the risk associated with COVID injections is comparable to the risk associated with getting COVID in 2020, with the injection risks increasing with each dose
* His message for the fellow scientists is to find their voice and stop being silent

This story is about a very brave researcher at Columbia University who co-authored a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355581860_COVID_vaccination_and_age-stratified_all-cause_mortality_risk) on risks associated with COVID vaccination (“vaccine-induced fatality rate”), in October 2021.

The researcher’s name is Spiro Pantazatos, Ph.D. He is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Neurobiology (Psychiatry) at Columbia University. He is also Research Scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. The title of his paper (a preprint) is “COVID vaccination and age-stratified all-cause mortality risk”:

&gt;*“Accurate estimates of COVID vaccine-induced severe adverse event and death rates are critical for risk-benefit ratio analyses of vaccination and boosters against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in different age groups. However, existing surveillance studies are not designed to reliably estimate life-threatening event or vaccine-induced fatality rates (VFR).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Here, regional variation in vaccination rates was used to predict all-cause mortality and non-COVID deaths in subsequent time periods using two independent, publicly available datasets from the US and Europe (month-and week-level resolutions, respectively).”*

Currently Dr. Pantazatos is trying to fund a home for this paper but all journals where he submitted it have declined so far.

Dr. Pantazatos was interviewed for the “Perspectives on the Pandemic” series, and in my opinion, the interview came out stunning (with a disclaimer that the topic is gruesome, so it’s a stunning interview about a horrible thing). Dr. Pantazatos’ presentation is so graceful and even-headed that it could be “the” video to send to your friends who have been calling you crazy all this time!

His paper:

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355581860\_COVID\_vaccination\_and\_age-stratified\_all-cause\_mortality\_risk](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355581860_COVID_vaccination_and_age-stratified_all-cause_mortality_risk)

**In the video he explains that there are 150,000 to a 180,000 death in the first 6 month of vaccinations in the USA.**

There have been a lot of reports and analysis of what is going on in and around Ukraine since Russian troops first entered Ukraine in February. It has been often suggested and demonstrated that the war between Russia and Ukraine is really a war between Russia and the USA/NATO.,"What I myself see in Ukraine is what I also see in Syria.  I see Russia getting an unprecedented opportunity to test and refine its weaponry, its tactics and its strategy.  I see Russia, which by the way is the world's largest nation in terms of size, learning what works well in conflict, and what doesn't work so well in conflict.  I see a nation far more united in purpose and vision than any other nation is.  I see the shape of the 21st century taking place in the cooperative agreements between Russia, China, India, Iran, and virtually all of the countries in Africa and South/Central America.

Is it possible to deliver aid inside Ukraine?,"A over-enthusiastic author / speaker / businessman is planning to go into Ukraine to deliver aid.  Is that even possible?  Kris Krohn is making remarks on Instagram that he is going to Ukraine, although I don't see it in writing on his websites: [https://support.krohnbreakthrough.org/fundraiser/3846120](https://support.krohnbreakthrough.org/fundraiser/3846120)

I will continue to follow him and see if he enters the country.  My hunch is he will not.

CORRECTION:  Krohn does claim he will fly his personal jet into Ukraine in June:

"" **by June 1, 2022. On that day, Kris, along with the top fundraisers for this operation, will board his jet to personally deliver 2,500 lbs. of humanitarian aid to the largest border crossing in Poland called Medyka. Once in Poland, Kris, along with two of our nonprofit partners known as Ukrainian Refugee Rescue and Allied Extract, will push hard to complete two primary objectives:** 

1. **Direct Impact on Besieged Cities: In partnership with Allied Extract, aid will be given to assist the people trapped behind enemy lines immediately. We will accomplish this by resupplying civilian convoys headed to besieged cities of Eastern Ukraine with emergency medical supplies. These supplies will be delivered to areas of greatest need and will save lives.** 
2. **Long-term relief: In partnership with Ukrainian Refugee Rescue, long-term support will be put in place to care for the women and children at The Center for Humanitarian Aid in Szegini.** :",caem123,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/uce67k/is_it_possible_to_deliver_aid_inside_ukraine/,0

Tesla Reddit Conspiracy from 2012/2013,"For all you folks who were on reddit back then, do you remember this conspiracy about Tesla? It basically predicted that by some time in the 2020s Tesla would be the largest company in the world. Most Americans would be working for Tesla. They would be driving a Tesla. Living in a Tesla house with Tesla solar panels. Getting paid by Tesla with what may not even be dollars$ but instead just to get their free Tesla car and Tesla house. 

I am obviously summarizing it but it was a very extensive post that was long and went into great detail about how this socialist Tesla economy would look like. I remember reading it and thinking this guy just stole an idea from a Black mirror episode. But now almost 10 years later its crazy how accurate the ""prediction"" was, almost like it was a legit time traveller lol, and i don't believe in any of that stuff.

Does anyone else remember reading this conspiracy?",jack3dp,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ubsx29/tesla_reddit_conspiracy_from_20122013/,0
